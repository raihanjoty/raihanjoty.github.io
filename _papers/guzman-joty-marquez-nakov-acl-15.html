abstract: 'We present a novel framework for machine translation evaluation using neural
  networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation
  from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical,
  syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is
  compacted into relatively small distributed vector representations, and fed into
  a multi-layer neural network that models the interaction between each of the hypotheses
  and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. These compact representations
  are in turn based on word and sentence embeddings, which are learned using neural
  networks. The framework is flexible, allows for efficient learning and classification,
  and yields correlation with humans that rivals the state of the art.
