abstract: 'The task of answering complex questions requires inferencing and synthesizing
  information from multiple documents that can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented,
  informative multi-document summarization. In generic summarization the stochastic,
  graph-based random walk method to compute the relative importance of textual units
  (i.e. sentences) is proved to be very successful. However, the major limitation
  of the TF^*IDF approach is that it only retains the frequency of the words and does
  not take into account the sequence, syntactic and semantic information. This paper
  presents the impact of syntactic and semantic information in the graph-based random
  walk method for answering complex questions. Initially, we apply tree kernel functions
  to perform the similarity measures between sentences in the random walk framework.
  Then, we extend our work further to incorporate the Extended String Subsequence
  Kernel (ESSK) to perform the task in a similar manner. Experimental results show
  the effectiveness of the use of kernels to include the syntactic and semantic information
  for this task.
