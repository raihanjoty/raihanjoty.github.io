abstract: 'This paper addresses the problem of speech act recognition in written asynchronous
  conversations (e.g., fora, emails). We propose a class of conditional structured
  models defined over arbitrary graph structures to capture the conversational dependencies
  between sentences. Our models use sentence representations encoded by a long short
  term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural model. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness
  of our approach over existing ones: (i) LSTMs provide better task-specific representations,
  and (ii) the global joint model improves over local models.
