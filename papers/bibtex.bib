Query–relevant summarization tries to remove the onus on the end–user by providing more condensed and direct access to relevant information. Query–relevant summarization is the task to synthesize a fluent, well–organized summary of the document collection that answers the user questions. We extracted several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, statistical and cosine similarity ) for each of the sentences in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query.

measure, semantic similarity measure,

characteristics which differ from written monologues (e.g., text books, news articles)

like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variations, which are successful in
finding topics in monologue or dialog, may not be successful by themselves in
asynchronous written conversations like emails. However, an effective combination
of LDA with other important features can give us the desired results. We first
point out the specific characteristics of emails that we need to consider in order to
find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation. Then we demonstrate
why the generative topic models by themselves may not be adequate for this task.
We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to
our proposed approach is that it captures the discriminative email features and integrates
the strengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique
considering LDA yet as one of the important factors.},

a two-stage document-level discourse
parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree
by applying an optimal parsing algorithm
to probabilities inferred from two Conditional
Random Fields: one for intrasentential
parsing and the other for multisentential
parsing. We present two approaches
to combine these two stages of
discourse parsing effectively. A set of
empirical evaluations over two different

parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art,

framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory,

CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse
segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a
given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing
algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential

different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality.
METHODS:
Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM).
RESULTS:
Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. “CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463).
CONCLUSIONS:
Deep learning methods can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth solutions for sleep.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of comment
classification in community Question Answering.
Following the state of the art, we approach
the task with a global inference process
to exploit the information of all comments
in the answer-thread in the form of a
fully connected graph. Our contribution comprises
two novel joint learning models that are
on-line and integrate inference within learning.
The first one jointly learns two node- and
edge-level MaxEnt classifiers with stochastic
gradient descent and integrates the inference
step with loopy belief propagation. The second
model is an instance of fully connected
pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model
significantly outperforms all other approaches
and yields the best results on the task to date.
Crucial elements for its success are the global
normalization and an Ising-like edge potential.},

In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address two types of information needs of response organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets and 2) classifying them into topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation of words and learn the representation as well as higher level features automatically for the classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations.

We first design discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation quality.}

We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.}

However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.}

different times, performing certain communicative acts, called speech acts (e.g., question, request).
In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to speech act recognition in asynchronous
conversations. Our approach works in two main steps: a long short-term memory recurrent
neural network (LSTM-RNN) first encodes each sentence separately into a task-specific distributed
representation, which is then used in a conditional random field (CRF) model to
capture the conversational dependencies between sentences. The LSTM-RNN uses pretrained
word embeddings learned from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences
into speech act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational
dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem of
limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model to learn
from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using domain adversarial training of neural
networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i)
LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations, (ii) conversational word embeddings
benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf ones, (iii) adversarial training gives better
domain-invariant representations, and (iv) the global CRF model improves over local models.

  abstract={In recent years there has been a growing interest in deep neural networks (DNN)
and representation learning with applications to a myriad of NLP and data
mining problems. The success of DNNs is heavily dependent on the availability
of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data is a big challenge in many
real-world problems. In such cases, a DNN model can leverage labeled and
unlabeled data from a related domain, but it has to deal with the shift in data
distributions between the domains. In this paper, we study the problem of
classifying social media posts during a crisis event (e.g., Earthquake). For
that, we use labeled and unlabeled data from past similar events (e.g., Flood)
and unlabeled data for the current event. We propose a novel model that
performs adversarial learning based domain adaptation to deal with distribution
drifts and graph based semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data
within a single unified deep learning framework.
Our experiments with two real-world crisis datasets collected from Twitter
demonstrate significant improvements over several baselines.}

In general, the mapping function is learned from a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English) parallel corpus.

To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset.}

Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is no mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of sleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism.  We propose, for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow signal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep staging by eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusively on extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying much attention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence.  We propose an end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous methods by 10\% 
using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep staging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on sleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect this study to motivate new research questions in sleep science.

We use sophisticated composition methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities be- tween tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations that are customized for a specific ER task under different scenarios. We propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking approach that takes all at- tributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that con- sider only a few attributes. We evaluate our algorithms on multiple datasets (including benchmarks, biomedical data, as well as multi-lingual data) and the extensive experimental results show that DeepER outperforms existing solutions.}

and written conversations, with a focus on computational models for three related topics: conversational
structure, summarization and sentiment detection, and group dynamics. We provide examples of specific
NLP tasks within those three areas, how they relate to one another, their applications, and how we
evaluate task performance.
We will begin by discussing motivations and applications of applying NLP methods to conversations,
including downstream applications that could benefit. Attendees will hear about the challenges of working
with noisy data, and examples of datasets of spoken and/or written conversations.
The first part of the tutorial covers conversational structures, the basic building blocks for working
with conversational data. Participants will learn about computational methods for uncovering thread and
topic structures of a conversation, detecting dialogue acts and adjacency pairs, identifying participant
roles (where relevant), and how to treat disfluencies. We will cover methods for both synchronous (e.g.,
meeting, phone) and asynchronous (e.g., forum, email) conversations.
In the second part of the tutorial, we will focus on sentiment analysis and summarization. Attendees
will learn about the related, overlapping tasks of detecting sentiment, subjectivity, and opinions. We will
cover unsupervised and supervised approaches, as well as multimodal sentiment detection. Participants
will learn about intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation of sentiment analysis methods for conversations.
For summarization, we will cover core topics, such as the notions of extractive vs. abstractive summarization,
and summarization vs. compression. In particular, participants will learn about the limits of
extractive summarization on noisy and opinion-filled conversation data. We will particularly emphasize
the question of how to evaluate automatically generated summaries, including some of the controversial
history surrounding automatic summarization metrics that are widely used.
In the final part of the tutorial, participants will learn about the growing field of research that uses NLP
and machine learning methods to model and predict group dynamics, including prediction of group
performance and participant affect. Attendees will learn about the close relationship between these three
areas of summarization, sentiment, and group dynamics, and why researchers in each one of those areas
often end up being concerned with the other two topics as well. Finally, we will discuss promising
current and future directions of applying NLP to conversations.}

However, most of the existing models depend heavily on paired image-sentence datasets, which are very expensive to acquire in most real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scene graph based approach for unpaired image captioning. Our method merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, an image scene graph generator, and a sentence scene graph generator. The sentence corpus is used to teach the decoder how to generate meaningful sentences from a scene graph. To further encourage the generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, we employ adversarial learning to align the visual scene graph to the textual scene graph. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generate quite promising results without using any image-caption training pairs, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin.}

The state-of-the-art video captioning methods focus more on encoding the temporal information, while lack of effective ways to remove irrelevant temporal information and also neglecting the spatial details. However, the current RNN encoding module in single time order can be influenced by the irrelevant temporal information, especially the irrelevant temporal information is at the beginning of the encoding. In addition, neglecting spatial information will lead to the relationship confusion of the words and detailed loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel recurrent video encoding method and a novel visual spatial feature for the video captioning task. The recurrent encoding module encodes the video twice with the predicted key frame to avoid the irrelevant temporal information often occurring at the beginning and the end of a video. The novel spatial features represent the spatial information in different regions of a video and enrich the details of a caption. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show superior performance of the proposed method.},

Second, we improve our initial SAR models
by semi-supervised learning in the form of
pretrained word embeddings learned from a
large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally,
we employ adversarial training to improve the
results further by leveraging the labeled data

modeling the shift in two domains.},

We evaluate our method on four disorder pre- diction tasks using linear classifiers. Empirical evaluation and analysis demonstrate that our proposed method performs bet- ter than many strong baselines, and adversarial learning helps improve the generalizability of our representations by pro- moting subject invariant features. We also show that using the representations at the level of a day works the best since human activity is structured in terms of daily routines.}

  abstract={A common approach to improve neural machine translation is to invent new architectures. However, the research process of designing and refining such new models is often exhausting. Another approach is to resort to huge extra monolingual data to conduct semi-supervised training, like back-translation. But extra monolingual data is not always available, especially for low resource languages. In this paper, we propose to diversify the available training data by using multiple forward and backward peer models to augment the original training dataset. Our method does not require extra data like back-translation, nor additional computations and parameters like using pretrained models. Our data diversification method achieves state-of-the-art BLEU score of 30.7 in the WMT'14 English-German task. It also consistently and substantially improves translation quality in 8 other translation tasks: 4 IWSLT tasks (English-German and English-French) and 4 low-resource translation tasks (English-Nepali and English-Sinhala).}

However, current human-annotated visual relationship datasets suffer from the long-tailed predicate distribution problem which limits the potentials of visual relationship models. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised method that implicitly learns the visual relationships without relying on any ground-truth visual relationship annotations. Our method relies on 1) intra- and inter-modality encodings to respectively model relationships within each modality separately and jointly, and 2) relationship probing, which seeks to discover the graph structure within each modality. By leveraging masked language modeling, contrastive learning, and dependency tree distances for self-supervision, our method can learn better object features as well as implicit visual relationships. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on various vision-language tasks that benefit from improved visual relationship understanding.}

In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised method to learn cross-lingual word embeddings for BLI. Our model is independent of the isomorphic assumption and uses nonlinear mapping in the latent space of two independently trained auto-encoders. Through extensive experiments on fifteen (15) different language pairs (in both directions) comprising resource-rich and low-resource languages from two different datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models by a good margin.

Although comprehension by human readers is usually unimpaired by non-standard inflection use, NLP systems are not so robust. We introduce a new Base-Inflection Encoding of English text that is achieved by combining linguistic and statistical techniques. Fine-tuning pre-trained NLP models for downstream tasks under this novel encoding achieves robustness to non-standard inflection use while maintaining performance on Standard English examples. Models using this encoding also generalize better to non-standard dialects without explicit training. We suggest metrics to evaluate tokenizers and extensive model-independent analyses demonstrate the efficacy of the encoding when used together with data-driven subword tokenizers.},

In this paper, we present a new framework of conversational machine reading with a novel Explicit Memory Tracker (EMT) that explicitly tracks whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision.
Moreover, our framework generates clarifying questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level selection scores to weight token-level distributions. 
On the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set), EMT achieves new state-of-the-art results of 74.8% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 46.0 BLEU4. 
We also show that EMT is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented reasoning process as the conversation flows.

However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks.

  abstract = {Change Captioning is a task that aims to describe the difference between images with natural language. Most existing methods treat this problem as a difference judgment without the existence of distractors such as viewpoint changes. However, in practice, viewpoint changes happen often and can overwhelm the real difference to be described. In this paper, we propose a novel visual encoder to explicitly distinguish viewpoint changes from real changes in the change captioning task. Moreover, we further simulate the attention preference of humans and propose a novel reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the attention directly with the language evaluation rewards. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both Spot-the-Diff and CLEVR-Change datasets.},

Besides, finding the optimal number of layers involves trial-and-error attempts. In this paper, the universal speech transformer is proposed, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work to use universal transformer for speech recognition. It generalizes the speech transformer with dynamic numbers of encoder/decoder layers, which can relieve the burden of tuning depth related hyperparameters. Universal transformer adds the depth and positional embeddings repeatedly for each layer, which dilutes the acoustic information carried by hidden representation, and it also performs a partial update of hidden vectors between layers, which is less efficient especially on the very deep models. For better use of universal transformer, we modify its processing framework by removing the depth embedding and only adding the positional embedding once at transformer encoder frontend. Furthermore, to update the hidden vectors efficiently, especially on the very deep models, we adopt a full update. Experiments on LibriSpeech, Switchboard and AISHELL-1 datasets show that our model outperforms a baseline by 3.88%-13.7%, and surpasses other model with less computation cost.}

In this paper, we propose to conduct speaker aware training for ASR in transformer model. Specifically, we propose to embed speaker knowledge through a persistent memory model into speech transformer encoder at utterance level. The speaker information is represented by a number of static speaker i-vectors, which is concatenated to speech utterance at each encoder self-attention layer. Persistent memory is thus formed by carrying speaker information through the depth of encoder. The speaker knowledge is captured from self-attention between speech and persistent memory vector in encoder.

This model architecture disperses the attention distribution over entire input to learn long-term dependencies, which is important for some sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as neural machine translation and text summarization. However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has a characteristic to have monotonic alignment between text output and speech input. Techniques like Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), RNN Transducer (RNN-T) and Recurrent Neural Aligner (RNA) build on top of this monotonic alignment and use local encoded speech representations for corresponding token prediction. In this paper, we present an effective cross attention biasing technique in transformer that takes monotonic alignment between text output and speech input into consideration by making use of cross attention weights. Specifically, a Gaussian mask is applied on cross attention weights to limit the input speech context range locally given alignment information. We further introduce a regularizer for alignment regularization. Experiments on LibriSpeech dataset find that our proposed model can obtain improved output-input alignment for ASR, and yields 14.5%-25.0% relative word error rate (WER) reductions.}

  abstract={Cross-lingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning cross-lingual embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this article,  we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with European, non-European and low-resource languages from two different datasets show that our method achieves better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system. Along with performing comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of our adversarial model, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the refinement procedures to understand their effects.

  abstract={Rumors spread in social media severely jeopardize the credibility of online content. Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we firstly represent the diffusion of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that 1) our RvNN-based models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art approaches; 2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and 3) our approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at very early stage.

Despite the great progress of video captioning research, particularly in video feature encoding, the language decoder is still largely based on the prevailing recurrent structure such as LSTM, which tends to prefer frequent words that align with the video and do not generalize well to new videos. In this paper, we propose a boundary-aware hierarchical language decoder for video captioning, which consists of a high-level de- coder, working as a global (caption-level) language model, and a low-level decoder, working as a local (phrase-level) language model. Most importantly, we introduce a binary gate into the low-level language decoder to detect the phrasal boundaries. To- gether with other advanced components including a joint video prediction module, a shared soft attention, and a boundary-aware video encoding module, our integrated video captioning framework can discover hierarchical language information and dis- tinguish the subjects from the objects of the verbs in a sentence, which are usually confusing during caption generation. Extensive experiments on two widely-used video captioning datasets, MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT) and YouTube-to-Text (MSVD), show that our method is highly competitive, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care.

Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application.

Methods: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis.

Results: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education.

Conclusions: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence–driven, and smartphone app–delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents’ formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.}

  abstract={Large-scale vision and language representation learning has shown promising improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a transformer-based multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens (region-based image features) and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and word tokens are unaligned, it is challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn image-text interactions. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss to ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum model. We provide a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information maximization perspective, showing that different training tasks can be interpreted as different ways to generate views for an image-text pair. ALBEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR2, ALBEF achieves absolute improvements of 2.37\% and 3.84\% compared to the state-of-the-art, while enjoying faster inference speed. Code and pre-trained models are available at .}

We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model is unified in that it builds on a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks, and it employs a unified format of task control codes to allow for multi-task learning. We propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training objective that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. To further close the gap between the pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose a bimodal dual generation task to encourage the alignment between NL and PL. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. 
Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information from code.}

In this work, we propose a unified speaker adaptation approach consisting of feature adaptation and model adaptation. For feature adaptation, we employ a speaker-aware persistent memory model which generalizes better to unseen test speakers by making use of speaker i-vectors to form a persistent memory. For model adaptation, we use a novel gradual pruning method to adapt to target speakers without changing the model architecture, which to the best of our knowledge, has never been explored in ASR. Specifically, we gradually prune less contributing parameters on model encoder to a certain sparsity level, and use the pruned parameters for adaptation, while freezing the unpruned parameters to keep the original model performance. We conduct experiments on the Librispeech dataset. Our proposed approach brings relative 2.74-6.52\% word error rate (WER) reduction on general speaker adaptation. On target speaker adaptation, our method outperforms the baseline with up to 20.1\% relative WER reduction, and surpasses the finetuning method by up to relative 8.62\%. Besides, with extremely low-resource adaptation data (e.g., 1 utterance), our method could improve the WER by relative 6.53\% with only a few epochs of training.}

  abstract={Transfer learning has yielded state-of-the-art results in many supervised natural language processing tasks. However, annotated data for every target task in every target language is rare, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we propose MultiMix, a novel data augmentation method for semi-supervised learning in zero-shot transfer learning scenarios. In particular, MultiMix targets to solve cross-lingual adaptation problems from a source (language) distribution to an unknown target (language) distribution assuming it has no training labels in the target language task. In its heart, MultiMix performs simultaneous self-training with data augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we have performed extensive experiments on zero-shot transfers for cross-lingual named entity recognition (XNER) and natural language inference (XNLI). Our experiments show sizeable improvements in both tasks outperforming the baselines by a good margin.},

  abstract = {We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency parsing problems (syntactic and discourse parsing) into a series of conditional splitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports efficient top-down decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation, discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring  segmentation as a pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained representations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more computationally expensive than ours. In discourse parsing, our method outperforms SoTA by a good margin. Our source code will be publicly available.},

This paper addresses zero-shot transfer for cross-lingual NER, especially when the amount of source-language training data is also limited. The paper first proposes a simple but effective labeled sequence translation method to translate source-language training data to target languages and avoids problems such as word order change and entity span determination. With the source-language data as well as the translated data, a generation-based multilingual data augmentation method is introduced to further increase diversity by generating synthetic labeled data in multiple languages. These augmented data enable the language model based NER models to generalize better with both the language-specific features from the target-language synthetic data and the language-independent features from multilingual synthetic data. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to demonstrate encouraging cross-lingual transfer performance of the new research on a wide variety of target languages.

Due to the lack of such large corpora in low-resource language pairs,  NMT systems often exhibit poor performance. Extra relevant monolingual data often helps, but acquiring it could be quite expensive, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, domain mismatch between bitext (train/test) and monolingual data might degrade the performance. To alleviate such issues, we propose AugVic, a novel data augmentation framework for low-resource NMT which exploits the vicinal samples of the given bitext without using any extra monolingual data explicitly. It can diversify the in-domain bitext data with finer level control. Through extensive experiments on four low-resource language pairs comprising data from different domains, we have shown that our method is comparable to the traditional back-translation that uses extra in-domain monolingual data. When we combine the synthetic parallel data generated from AugVic with the ones from the extra monolingual data, we achieve further improvements. We show that AugVic helps to attenuate the discrepancies between relevant and distant-domain monolingual data in traditional back-translation. To understand the contributions of different components of AugVic, we perform an in-depth framework analysis.},

In multilingual communities, it is common for polyglots to code-mix when conversing with each other. Inspired by this phenomenon, we present two strong black-box adversarial attacks (one word-level, one phrase-level) for multilingual models that push their ability to handle code-mixed sentences to the limit. The former uses bilingual dictionaries to propose perturbations and translations of the clean example for sense disambiguation. The latter directly aligns the clean example with its translations before extracting phrases as perturbations. Our phrase-level attack has a success rate of 89.75\% against XLM-R$_\text{large}$, bringing its average accuracy of 79.85 down to 8.18 on XNLI. Finally, we propose an efficient adversarial training scheme that trains in the same number of steps as the original model and show that it improves model accuracy.},

Our unified parsing model adopts a beam search to decode the best tree structure by searching through a space of high scoring trees. With extensive experiments on the standard RST discourse treebank, we demonstrate that our parser outperforms existing methods by a good margin in both end-to-end parsing and parsing with gold segmentation. More importantly, it does so without using any handcrafted features, making it faster and easily adaptable to new languages and domains.},

We achieve state-of-the-art, zero-shot abstractive summarization performance on the CNN-DailyMail dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three additional, diverse datasets. The models fine-tuned in this unsupervised manner are more robust to noisy data and also achieve better few-shot performance using 10 and 100 training examples.

As real input noise is difficult to predict during training, robustness is a big issue for system deployment. In this paper, we improve the robustness of NMT models by reducing the effect of noisy words through a Context-Enhanced Reconstruction (CER) approach. CER trains the model to resist noise in two steps: (1) perturbation step that breaks the naturalness of input sequence with made-up words; (2) reconstruction step that defends the noise propagation by generating better and more robust contextual representation. Experimental results on Chinese-English (ZH-EN) and French-English (FR-EN) translation tasks demonstrate robustness improvement on both news and social media text. Further fine-tuning experiments on social media text show our approach can converge at a higher position and provide a better adaptation.},

evaluated only on synthetic tasks, which may not be representative of their performance in downstream applications. To investigate how representative the synthetic tasks are of downstream use cases, we conduct experiments on
benchmarking well-known traditional and neural coherence models on synthetic sentence ordering tasks, and contrast this with their performance on three downstream applications: coherence evaluation for MT and summarization,

However, using end- to-end models for online speech recognition is known to suf- fer from an early endpointing problem, which brings in many deletion errors. In this paper, we propose to address the early endpointing problem from the gradient perspective. Specifi- cally, we leverage on the recently proposed ScaleGrad tech- nique, which was proposed to mitigate the text degeneration issue. Different from ScaleGrad, we adapt it to discourage the early generation of the end-of-sentence (<eos>) token. A scaling term is added to directly maneuver the gradient of the training loss to encourage the model to learn to keep generating non-<eos> tokens. Compared with previous ap- proaches such as voice-activity-detection and end-of-query detection, the proposed method does not rely on various types of silence, and it also saves the trouble from obtaining the ground truth endpoint with forced alignment. Nevertheless, it can be jointly applied with other techniques. Experiments on AISHELL-1 dataset show that our model brings relative 5.4%-10.1% CER reductions over the baseline, and surpasses the unlikelihood training method which directly reduces the generation probability of <eos> token.}

The query optimization process produces a query execution plan (qep), which represents an execution strategy for an sql query. Unfortunately, in practice, it is often difficult for a learner to comprehend query execution strategies by perusing vendor-specific qeps, hindering her learning process. In this paper, we present a novel, end-to-end, generic sys- tem called lantern that generates a natural language description of a qep to enhance its understanding. It takes as input an sql query and its qep, and generates a natural language description of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying rdbms. Specifi- cally, it deploys a declarative framework called pool that enables subject matter experts to efficiently create and maintain natural language descriptions of physical operators used in qeps. A rule- based framework called rule-lantern is proposed that exploits pool to generate natural language descriptions of qeps. Despite the high accuracy of rule-lantern, our engagement with learners reveal that consistent with existing psychology theories perusing such rule-based descriptions lead to boredom due to repetitive state- ments across different qeps. To address this issue, we present a novel deep learning-based language generation framework called neural-lantern that infuses language variability in the gener- ated description by exploiting a set of paraphrasing tools and word embedding. Our experimental study with real learners shows the effectiveness of lantern in facilitating comprehension of qeps.}

Our method works well on several summarization datasets, improving both the ROUGE scores and qualitative properties of fused summaries. It is especially good when the candidates to fuse are worse, such as in the few-shot setup where we set a new state-of-the-art.}

Decomposing a complex task into modular components can enable robust generalisation under such non-stationary environment. However, current modular approaches in NLP do not take advantage of recent advances in parameter efficient tuning of pretrained language models. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{\small{ModularPrompt}}, a label-modular prompt tuning framework for text classification tasks. In  \textsc{\small{ModularPrompt}}, the input prompt consists of a sequence of soft \emph{label} prompts, each encoding modular knowledge related to the corresponding class label. In two of most formidable settings,  \textsc{\small{ModularPrompt}} outperforms relevant baselines by a large margin demonstrating strong generalisation ability. We also conduct comprehensive analysis to validate whether the learned prompts satisfy properties of a modular representation.}

In this work, we explore methods to make better use of the multilingual annotation and language agnostic property of KG triples, and present novel knowledge based multilingual language models (KMLMs) trained directly on the knowledge triples. We first generate a large amount of multilingual synthetic sentences using the Wikidata KG triples. Then based on the intra- and inter-sentence structures of the generated data, we design pretraining tasks to enable the LMs to not only memorize the factual knowledge but also learn useful logical patterns. Our pretrained KMLMs demonstrate significant performance improvements on a wide range of knowledge-intensive cross-lingual tasks, including named entity recognition (NER), factual knowledge retrieval, relation classification, and a newly designed logical reasoning task. Our code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.}

However, existing CL methods consider binary objects while modeling KG triplets and they are too generic, i.e., they ignore zero-shot, few-shot and synonymity problems that appear in OpenKGs. To address this, we propose TernaryCL, a CL framework based on ternary propagation patterns among head, relation and tail. TernaryCL designs  \emph{Contrastive Entity} and \emph{Contrastive Relation} to mine ternary discriminative features by considering both negative entities and relations. It also introduces \emph{Contrastive Self} to help zero- and few-shot entities learn discriminative features, \emph{Contrastive Synonym} to consider synonymous entities, and \emph{Contrastive Fusion} to aggregate graph features from multiple paths. With extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of TernaryCL over state-of-the-art models.}

  abstract = {Knowledge-enhanced language representation learning has shown promising results across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. However, prior methods are limited in efficient utilization of multilingual knowledge graph (KG) data for language model (LM) pretraining. They often train LMs with KGs in indirect ways, relying on extra entity/relation embeddings to facilitate knowledge injection. In this work, we explore methods to make better use of the multilingual annotation and language agnostic property of KG triples, and present novel knowledge based multilingual language models (KMLMs) trained directly on the knowledge triples. We first generate a large amount of multilingual synthetic sentences using the Wikidata KG triples. Then based on the intra- and inter-sentence structures of the generated data, we design pretraining tasks to enable the LMs to not only memorize the factual knowledge but also learn useful logical patterns. Our pretrained KMLMs demonstrate significant performance improvements on a wide range of knowledge-intensive cross-lingual tasks, including named entity recognition (NER), factual knowledge retrieval, relation classification, and a newly designed logical reasoning task. Our code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.}

We demonstrate BotSIM's effectiveness in end-to-end evaluation, remediation and multi-intent dialog generation via case studies on two commercial bot platforms. BotSIM's "generation-simulation-remediation'" paradigm accelerates the end-to-end bot evaluation and iteration process by: 1) reducing the effort needed to create test cases; 2) enabling a better understanding of both NLU and end-to-end performance via extensive dialog simulation; 3) improving the bot troubleshooting  process with actionable suggestions from simulation results analysis.

greatly help kick-start the target low-resource translation tasks, the language

We instead use a basic model architecture and show significant improvements over state of the art within the same training regime. We then design a harder self-supervision objective by increasing the ratio of negative samples within a contrastive learning setup, and  enhance the model further through automatic hard negative mining coupled with a large global negative queue encoded by a momentum encoder. We show empirically that increasing the density of negative samples improves the basic model, and using a global negative queue further improves and stabilizes the model while training with hard negative samples. We evaluate the coherence model on task-independent test sets that resemble real-world applications and show significant improvements in coherence evaluations of downstream tasks.}

It is therefore necessary for the model to learn novel relational patterns with very few labeled data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous task knowledge. In this paper, we formulate this challenging yet practical problem as continual few-shot relation learning (CFRL). Based on the finding that learning for new emerging few-shot tasks often results in feature distributions that are incompatible with previous tasks' learned distributions, we propose a novel method based on embedding space regularization and data augmentation. Our method generalizes to new few-shot tasks and avoids catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks by enforcing extra constraints on the relational embeddings and by adding extra {relevant} data in a self-supervised manner. With extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in CFRL task settings.}

To tackle these limitations, we introduce a novel data curation method that generates GlobalWoZ --- a large-scale multilingual ToD dataset globalized from an English ToD dataset for three unexplored use cases of  multilingual ToD systems. Our method is based on translating dialogue templates and filling them with local entities in the target-language countries. Besides, we extend the coverage of target languages to 20 languages.

Considering that humans can continually learn new tasks from a handful of examples, we expect the models also to be able to generalize well on new few-shot tasks without forgetting the previous ones. In this work, we define this more challenging yet practical problem as Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for it based on prompt tuning of T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5 generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to achieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While adapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt embeddings for the new task. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LFPT5 can be applied to various different types of tasks and significantly outperform previous methods in different LFLL settings.},

  abstract={Neural Module Networks (NMNs) have been quite successful in incorporating explicit reasoning as learnable modules in various question answering tasks, including
the most generic form of numerical reasoning over text in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong
supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules
and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence
we propose Weakly-Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module Network (WNSMN)
trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical reasoning based MRC. It
learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained from the dependency parsing
of the query, as discrete actions over both neural and symbolic reasoning modules
and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement learning framework with discrete reward
from answer matching. On the numerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN outperforms NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8%
in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised settings.
This showcases the effectiveness and generalizability of modular networks that can
handle explicit discrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end manner.

Compared to traditional single-turn question generation (SQG), CQG is more challenging in the sense that the generated question is required not only to be meaningful, but also to align with the provided conversation. Previous studies mainly focus on how to model the flow and alignment of the conversation, but do not thoroughly study which parts of the context and history are necessary for the model. We believe that shortening the context and history is crucial as it can help the model to optimise more on the conversational alignment property. To this end, we propose CoHS-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework, which adopts a novel CoHS module to shorten the context and history of the input. In particular, it selects the top-p sentences and history turns by calculating the relevance scores of them. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on CoQA in both the answer-aware and answer-unaware settings.}

In this work, we present a novel unsupervised cross-lingual method to generate image captions in a target language without using any image-caption corpus in the source or target languages. Our method relies on (i) a cross-lingual scene graph to sentence translation process, which learns to decode sentences in the target language from a cross-lingual encoding space of scene graphs using a sentence parallel (bitext) corpus, and (ii) an unsupervised cross-modal feature mapping which seeks to map an encoded scene graph features from image modality to language modality.

Existing rdbms typically expose a query execution plan (qep) in visual or textual format, which describes the execution steps for a given query. However, it is often daunting for a learner to compre- hend these qeps containing vendor-specific implementation details. In this demonstration, we present a novel, generic, and portable system called lantern that generates a natural language-based description of the execution strategy chosen by the underlying rdbms to process a query. It provides a declarative framework called pool for subject matter experts (sme) to efficiently create and ma- nipulate natural language descriptions of physical operators of any rdbms. It then exploits pool to generate nl description of a qep by integrating rule-based and deep learning-based techniques to infuse language variability in the descriptions. Such nl generation strategy mitigates the impact of boredom on learners caused by repeated exposure of similar text generated by rule-based systems.}

The aim of IM, which is NP-hard, is to select a set of k users known as seed users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep reinforcement learning to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called PIANO that incorporates network embedding and reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. In order to make it practical, we further present PIANO-E and PIANO@⟨d⟩, both of which can be applied directly to answer IM without training the model from scratch. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that PIANO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the- art classical solutions. We also demonstrate that the learned parametric models generalize well across different networks. Besides, we provide a pool of pretrained PIANO models such that any IM task can be addressed by directly applying a model from the pool without training over the targeted network.}

Next, we propose an automatic algorithm to compress task definitions to a minimal supporting set of tokens, and find that 60\% of tokens can be removed while maintaining or even improving model performance. Based on these results, we propose two strategies to help models better leverage task instructions: (1) providing only key information for tasks in a common structured format, and (2) adding a meta-tuning stage to help the model better understand the definitions. With these two strategies, we achieve a 4.2 Rouge-L improvement over 119 unseen test tasks.}

  abstract = {Human evaluation is the foundation upon which the evaluation of both summarization systems and automatic metrics rests. However, existing human evaluation studies for summarization either exhibit a low inter-annotator agreement or have insufficient scale, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is lacking. Therefore, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization evaluation along the following axes: (1) We propose a modified summarization salience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which is based on fine-grained semantic units and allows for a high inter-annotator agreement. (2) We curate the Robust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation dataset consisting of 22,000 summary-level annotations over 28 top-performing systems on three datasets. (3) We conduct a comparative study of four human evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in evaluation setups. (4) We evaluate 50 automatic metrics and their variants using the collected human annotations across evaluation protocols and demonstrate how our benchmark leads to more statistically stable and significant results. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating large language models (LLMs), as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g., GPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the annotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust, targeted evaluation methods.}

Prior work has also predominantly framed simplification as a single-step, input-to-output task, only implicitly modeling the fine-grained, span-level edits that elucidate the simplification process.
To address both gaps, we introduce the SWiPE dataset, which reconstructs the document-level editing process from English Wikipedia (EW) articles to paired Simple Wikipedia (SEW) articles. 
In contrast to prior work, SWiPE leverages the entire revision history when pairing pages in order to better identify simplification edits. We work with Wikipedia editors to annotate 5,000 EW-SEW document pairs, labeling more than 40,000 edits with proposed 19 categories.
To scale our efforts, we propose several models to automatically label edits, achieving an F-1 score of up to 71.8, indicating that this is a tractable but challenging NLU task. 
Finally, we categorize the edits produced by several simplification models and find that SWiPE-trained models generate more complex edits while reducing unwanted edits.}

However, they are also known to be significantly brittle against specifically crafted adversarial examples, leading to increasing interest in probing the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. We introduce RSMI, a novel two-stage framework that combines randomized smoothing (RS) with masked inference (MI) to improve the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. RS transforms a classifier into a smoothed classifier to obtain robust representations, whereas MI forces a model to exploit the surrounding context of a masked token in an input sequence. RSMI improves adversarial robustness by 2 to 3 times over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We also perform in-depth qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of the different stages of RSMI and probe the impact of its components through extensive ablations. By empirically proving the stability of RSMI, we put it forward as a practical method to robustly train large-scale NLP models. Our code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RSMI.}

Despite this, PT has been shown to rely heavily on good initialization of the prompt embeddings. In this work, we study meta prompt tuning (MPT) to systematically explore how meta-learning can help improve (if it can) cross-task generalization in PT through learning to initialize the prompt embeddings from other relevant tasks. We empirically analyze a representative set of meta learning algorithms in a wide range of adaptation settings with different source/target task configurations on a large set of few-shot tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPT. We find the improvement to be significant particularly on classification tasks. For other kinds of tasks such as question answering, we observe that while MPT can outperform PT in most cases, it does not always outperform multi-task learning. We further provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of task similarity.}

In this work, we present a novel method that operates on the hidden representations of a PLM to reduce overfitting. During fine-tuning, our method inserts random autoencoders between the hidden layers of a PLM, which transform activations from the previous layers into a multi-view compressed representation before feeding it into the upper layers. The autoencoders are plugged out after fine-tuning, so our method does not add extra parameters or increase computation cost during inference. Our method demonstrates promising performance improvement across a wide range of sequence- and token-level low-resource NLP tasks. We will make our source code publicly available for research purposes.}

  abstract = {Conversational Question Generation (CQG) is a critical task for machines to assist humans in fulfilling their information needs through conversations. The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality,  the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct, a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated conversation from a context. Compared with the existing answer-unaware CQG models, the proposed SG-CQG achieves state-of-the-art performance.}

The recently released ChatGPT language model has drawn a lot of attention, with discussions ongoing whether it achieves impressive performance due to its memorization power for being trained on a massive amount of data, or if it has complex reasoning capability to solve challenging tasks. This paper aims to systematically evaluate these issues. In particular, it focuses on investigating the performance of ChatGPT on academic benchmark datasets, assessing the quality of its generated text, exploring its open-domain knowledge and commonsense reasoning, as well as emerging capability. In addition, we study its potential limitations, such as biases, misinformation generation, and ethical concerns. Our extensive evaluation shows that even though ChatGPT is capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, and may obtain impressive performance in several benchmark datasets, it is still far from achieving the ability to reliably solve many language processing tasks in challenging scenarios.}

In this paper, we propose VMCL, a Contrastive Learning (CL) framework with graph guided Variational autoencoder on Meta-KGs in the inductive setting. We first propose representation generation to capture the encoded and generated representations of entities, where the generated variations can densify representations with complementary features. Then, we design two CL objectives that work across entities and meta-KGs to simulate the transfer mode. With extensive experiments we demonstrate that our proposed VMCL can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art baselines.}

Our approach improves the pre-trained unsupervised PEGASUS by 4.37% to 7.27% relative mean ROUGE across four widely-adopted summarization benchmarks, and achieves relative gains of 7.51% (up to 23.73% from XSum to WikiHow) averaged over 30 transfer setups.}

Existing approaches are neither effective nor efficient enough towards a practical semantic code search system.

To further reduce the high memory cost of deploying two separate models in practice, we propose to jointly train the fast and slow model based on a single transformer encoder with shared parameters. The proposed cascaded approach is not only efficient and scalable, but also achieves state-of-the-art results with an average mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) score of 0.7795 (across 6 programming languages) as opposed to the previous state-of-the-art result of 0.713 MRR on the CodeSearchNet benchmark.}

  abstract = {Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to reduce manual debugging efforts for developers and improve software reliability. While conventional search-based techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy assumption to mine fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep learning (DL) based approaches to automate the program repair process in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is often limited by a fixed set of parameters to model the highly complex search space of APR.

To ease such burden on the parametric models, in this work, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen) by explicitly leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous bug-fix pairs Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a language-agnostic manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In addition, we adapt a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our founda tion model to facilitate both patch retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We adopt a stage-wise approach where the patch retriever first retrieves a relevant external bug-fix pair to augment the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch generator, which synthesizes a ranked list of repair patch candidates. Notably, RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can flexibly integrate different patch retrievers and generators to repair various types of bugs.

We thoroughly evaluate RAP-Gen on three benchmarks in two programming languages, including the TFix benchmark in JavaScript, and Code Refinement and Defects4J benchmarks in Java, where the bug localization information may or may not be provided. Experimental results show that RAP-Gen significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) approaches on all benchmarks, e.g., boosting the accuracy of T5-large on TFix from 49.70% to 54.15% (repairing 478 more bugs) and repairing 15 more bugs on 818 Defects4J bugs. Further analysis reveals that our patch retriever can search for relevant fix patterns to guide the APR systems.}

However, a closer analysis reveals issues with existing evaluation benchmarks, affecting evaluation precision. To address this, we propose a new protocol for inconsistency detection benchmark creation and implement it in a 10-domain benchmark called SummEdits. This new benchmark is 20 times more cost-effective per sample than previous benchmarks and highly reproducible, as we estimate inter-annotator agreement at about 0.9. Most LLMs struggle on SummEdits, with performance close to random chance. The best-performing model, GPT-4, is still 8% below estimated human performance, highlighting the gaps in LLMs' ability to reason about facts and detect inconsistencies when they occur.}
