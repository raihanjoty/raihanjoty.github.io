abstract: 'We present a pairwise learning-to-rank approach to machine translation
  evaluation that learns to differentiate better from worse translations in the context
  of a given reference. We integrate several layers of linguistic information encapsulated
  in tree-based structures, making use of both the reference and the system output
  simultaneously, thus bringing our ranking closer to how humans evaluate translations.
  Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important,
  we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features
  automatically. The evaluation results show that learning in the proposed framework
  yields better correlation with humans than computing the direct similarity over
  the same type of structures. Also, we show our structural kernel learning (SKL)
  can be a general framework for MT evaluation, in which syntactic and semantic information
  can be naturally incorporated.
