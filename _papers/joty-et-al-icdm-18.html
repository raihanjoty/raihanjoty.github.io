abstract: 'Discourse processing is a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks
  to uncover linguistic structures from texts at several levels, which can support
  many text mining applications. This involves identifying the topic structure, the
  coherence structure, the coreference structure, and the conversation structure for
  conversational discourse. Taken together, these structures can inform text summarization,
  essay scoring, sentiment analysis, machine translation, information extraction,
  question answering, and thread recovery. The tutorial starts with an overview of
  basic concepts in discourse analysis – monologue vs. conversation, synchronous vs.
  asynchronous conversation, and key linguistic structures in discourse analysis.
  It then covers traditional machine learning methods along with the most recent works
  using deep learning, and compare their performances on benchmark datasets. For each
  discourse structure we describe, we show its applications in downstream text mining
  tasks.
