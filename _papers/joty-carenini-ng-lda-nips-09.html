abstract: 'Our research addresses the task of finding topics at the sentence level
  in email conversations. As an asynchronous collaborative application, email has
  its own characteristics which differ from written monologues (e.g., text books,
  news articles) or spoken dialogs (e.g., meetings). Hence, the generative topic models
  like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variations, which are successful
  in finding topics in monologue or dialog, may not be successful by themselves in
  asynchronous written conversations like emails. However, an effective combination
  of LDA with other important features can give us the desired results. We first point
  out the specific characteristics of emails that we need to consider in order to
  find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation. Then we demonstrate
  why the generative topic models by themselves may not be adequate for this task.
  We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to our
  proposed approach is that it captures the discriminative email features and integrates
  the strengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique considering
  LDA yet as one of the important factors.
