abstract: 'Despite increasing instances of machine translation (MT) systems including
  contextual information, the evidence for translation quality improvement is sparse,
  especially for discourse phenomena. Popular metrics like BLEU are not expressive
  or sensitive enough to capture quality improvements or drops that are minor in size
  but significant in perception. We introduce the first of their kind MT benchmark
  datasets that aim to track and hail improvements across four main discourse phenomena:
  anaphora, lexical consistency, coherence and readability, and discourse connective
  translation. We also introduce evaluation methods for these tasks, and evaluate
  several baseline MT systems on the curated datasets. Surprisingly, we find that
  existing context-aware models do not improve discourse-related translations consistently
  across languages and phenomena.
