abstract: 'Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information
  from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topicoriented, informative multi-document
  summarization. In this paper, we have experimented with one empirical and two unsupervised
  statistical machine learning techniques: kmeans and Expectation Maximization (EM),
  for computing relative importance of the sentences. However, the performance of
  these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these
  features. We extracted different kinds of features (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic,
  cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic)
  for each of the document sentences in order to measure its importance and relevancy
  to the user query. We used a local search technique to learn the weights of the
  features. For all our methods of generating summaries, we have shown the effects
  of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over the bag of words (BOW) features.
