abstract: 'Sequence-to-sequence deep neural models fine-tuned for abstractive summarization
  can achieve great performance on datasets with enough human annotations. Yet, it
  has been shown that they have not reached their full potential, with a wide gap
  between the top beam search output and the \emphoracle beam. Recently, re-ranking
  methods have been proposed, to learn to select a better summary candidate. However,
  such methods are limited by the summary quality  aspects captured by the first-stage
  candidates. To bypass this limitation, we propose a new paradigm in second-stage
  abstractive summarization called SummaFusion that fuses several summary candiates
  to produce a novel abstractive \emphsecond-stage summary. Our method works well
  on several summarization datasets, improving both the ROUGE scores and qualitative
  properties of fused summaries. It is especially good when the candidates to fuse
  are worse, such as in the few-shot setup where we set a new state-of-the-art.
