abstract: 'Research in image captioning has mostly focused on English because of the
  availability of image-caption paired datasets in this language. However, building
  vision-language systems only for English deprives a large part of the world population
  of AI technologies'' benefit. On the other hand, creating image-caption paired datasets
  for every target language is expensive. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised
  cross-lingual method to generate image captions in a target language without using
  any image-caption corpus in the source or target languages. Our method relies on
  (i) a cross-lingual scene graph to sentence translation process, which learns to
  decode sentences in the target language from a cross-lingual encoding space of scene
  graphs using a sentence parallel (bitext) corpus, and (ii) an unsupervised cross-modal
  feature mapping which seeks to map an encoded scene graph features from image modality
  to language modality. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on the
  Chinese image caption generation task. The comparisons against several existing
  methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
