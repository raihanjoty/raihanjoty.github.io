abstract: 'Community question answering (CQA) forums can provide effective means for
  sharing information and addressing a user''s information needs about particular
  topics. However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low
  quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find
  the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered
  design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying
  high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user''s
  requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization
  techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user,
  the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing
  related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization
  module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related
  comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA
  forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper
  insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable
  lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.
