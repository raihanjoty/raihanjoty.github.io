abstract: 'Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been
  shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
  it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer
  struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models
  like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform
  as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap
  with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention
  at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT
  translation tasks and the WMT''14 English-German task. It also yields improvements
  over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate
  that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model
  prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.
