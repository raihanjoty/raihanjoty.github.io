abstract: 'We present GradMask, a simple adversarial example detection scheme for
  natural language processing (NLP) models. It uses gradient signals to detect adversarially
  perturbed tokens in an input sequence and occludes such tokens by a masking process.
  GradMask provides several advantages over existing methods including improved detection
  performance and an interpretation of its decision with a only moderate computational
  cost. Its approximated inference cost is no more than a single forward- and back-propagation
  through the target model without requiring any additional detection module. Extensive
  evaluation on widely adopted NLP benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
  effectiveness of GradMask.
