abstract: 'The dominant paradigm of textual question answering systems is based on
  end-to-end neural networks, which excels at answering natural language questions
  but falls short on complex ones. This stands in contrast to the broad adaptation
  of semantic parsing approaches over structured data sources (e.g., relational database,
  knowledge graphs), that convert natural language questions to logical forms and
  execute them with query engines. Towards combining the strengths of neural and symbolic
  methods, we propose a framework of question parsing and execution on textual QA.
  It comprises two central pillars: (1) We parse the question of varying complexity
  into an intermediate representation, named H-expression, which is composed of simple
  questions as the primitives and symbolic operations representing the relationships
  among them; (2) To execute the resulting H-expressions, we design a hybrid executor,
  which integrates the deterministic rules to translate the symbolic operations with
  a drop-in neural reader network to answer each decomposed simple question. Hence,
  the proposed framework can be viewed as a top-down question parsing followed by
  a bottom-up answer backtracking. The resulting H-expressions closely guide the execution
  process, offering higher precision besides better interpretability while still preserving
  the advantages of the neural readers for resolving its primitive elements. Our extensive
  experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiQA, HotpotQA, and NQ show that the proposed parsing
  and hybrid execution framework outperforms existing approaches in supervised, few-shot,
  and zero-shot settings, while also effectively exposing its underlying reasoning
  process.
