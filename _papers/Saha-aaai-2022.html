abstract: 'Neural Module Networks (NMNs) have been quite successful in incorporating
  explicit reasoning as learnable modules in various question answering tasks, including
  the most generic form of numerical reasoning over text in Machine Reading Comprehension
  (MRC). However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong supervision in executing
  the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules and fail to generalize
  to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence we propose Weakly-Supervised
  Neuro-Symbolic Module Network (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision
  for numerical reasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program
  obtained from the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both
  neural and symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement
  learning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the numerical-answer
  subset of DROP, WNSMN outperforms NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model
  GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised
  settings. This showcases the effectiveness and generalizability of modular networks
  that can handle explicit discrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end
  manner.
