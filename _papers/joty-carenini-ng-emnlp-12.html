abstract: 'We propose a complete probabilistic discriminative framework for performing
  sentencelevel discourse analysis. Our framework comprises a discourse segmenter,
  based on a binary classifier, and a discourse parser, which applies an optimal CKY-like
  parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from a Dynamic Conditional Random Field.
  We show on two corpora that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, often
  by a wide margin.
