abstract: 'This paper presents an empirical study on using syntactic and semantic
  information for Concept Segmentation and Labeling (CSL), a well-known component
  in spoken language understanding. Our approach is based on reranking N-best outputs
  from a state-of-the-art CSL parser. We perform extensive experimentation by comparing
  different tree-based kernels with a variety of representations of the available
  linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS tags, shallow and
  full syntax, and discourse trees. The results show that the structured representation
  with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser,
  much larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation.
  We also show that shallow syntax helps improve the results and that discourse relations
  can be partially beneficial.
