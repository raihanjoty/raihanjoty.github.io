abstract: 'With the rise of powerful closed-sourced LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4), there are
  increasing interests in distilling the capabilies of close-sourced LLMs to smaller
  open-sourced LLMs. Previous distillation methods usually prompt ChatGPT to generate
  a set of instructions and answers, for the student model to learn. However, such
  standard distillation approach neglects the merits and conditions of the student
  model. Inspired by modern teaching principles, we design a personalised distillation
  process, in which the student attempts to solve a task first, then the teacher provides
  an adaptive refinement for the student to improve. Instead of feeding the student
  with teacher''s prior, personalised distillation enables personalised learning for
  the student model, as it only learns on examples it makes mistakes upon and learns
  to improve its own solution. On code generation, personalised distillation consistently
  outperforms standard distillation with only one third of the data. With only 2.5-3K
  personalised examples that incur a data-collection cost of 4-6$, we boost CodeGen-mono-16B
  by 7% to achieve 36.4% pass@1 and StarCoder by 12.2% to achieve 45.8% pass@1 on
  HumanEval.
