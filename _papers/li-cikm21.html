abstract: 'We study the task of span-level emotion cause analysis (SECA), which is
  focused on identifying the specific emotion cause span(s) triggering a certain emotion
  in the text. Compared to the popular clause-level emotion cause analysis (CECA),
  it is a finer-grained emotion cause analysis (ECA) task. Existing SECA method relies
  on the manually engineered features, which is labor-intensive and not generalized
  well. In this paper, we design a BERT-based graph attention network for emotion
  cause span(s) identification. The proposed model takes advantage the structure of
  BERT to capture the relationship information between emotion and text, and utilizes
  graph attention network to model the structure information of the text. Our SECA
  method can be easily used for extracting clause-level emotion causes for CECA as
  well. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperform
  the state-of-the-art ECA methods on benchmark emotion cause dataset.
