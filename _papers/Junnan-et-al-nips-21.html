abstract: 'Large-scale vision and language representation learning has shown promising
  improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a transformer-based
  multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens (region-based image features)
  and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and word tokens are unaligned, it is
  challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn image-text interactions. In this
  paper, we introduce a contrastive loss to ALign the image and text representations
  BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded
  vision and language representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method
  does not require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to
  improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training
  method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum model. We provide
  a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information maximization perspective,
  showing that different training tasks can be interpreted as different ways to generate
  views for an image-text pair. ALBEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple
  downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods
  that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR2, ALBEF
  achieves absolute improvements of 2.37\% and 3.84\% compared to the state-of-the-art,
  while enjoying faster inference speed. Code and pre-trained models are available
  at .
