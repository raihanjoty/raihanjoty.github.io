abstract: 'We address the problem of speech act recognition (SAR) in asynchronous
  conversations (e.g., forums, emails). However, unlike synchronous conversations
  (e.g., meetings, phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled datasets to train
  an effective SAR model. In this paper, we propose methods to effectively leverage
  abundant unlabeled conversational data and the available labeled data from synchronous
  domains. We carry out our research in three main steps. First, we introduce a neural
  architecture based on hierarchical LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF) for
  SAR in asynchronous conversations, and show that our method outperforms existing
  methods when trained on in-domain data only. Second, we improve our initial SAR
  models by semi-supervised learning in the form of pretrained word embeddings learned
  from a large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally, we employ adversarial training
  to improve the results further by leveraging the labeled data from synchronous domains
  and by explicitly modeling the shift in two domains.
