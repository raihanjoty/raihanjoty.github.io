abstract: 'Background: Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer
  programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly
  used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility,
  personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve
  patient care.  Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps,
  and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide
  recommendations for their future research, design, and application.  Methods: We
  performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical
  Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica
  database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational
  agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched
  the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center)
  WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles
  were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed
  in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing
  the principles of thematic analysis.  Results: The literature search yielded 47
  study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion
  criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone
  apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality.
  Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and
  only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported
  conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring,
  health care service support, and patient education.  Conclusions: The literature
  on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment
  and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial
  intelligence–driven, and smartphone app–delivered conversational agents. There is
  an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents’
  formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.
