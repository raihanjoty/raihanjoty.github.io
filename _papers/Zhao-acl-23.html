abstract: 'As large language models (LLMs) have become the norm in NLP, demonstrating
  good performance in generation and reasoning tasks, one of its most fatal disadvantages
  is the lack of factual correctness. Generating unfactual texts not only leads to
  lower performances but also degrades the trust and validity of their applications.
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves trust and model performance on complex
  reasoning tasks by generating interpretable reasoning chains, but still suffers
  from factuality concerns in knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose
  the Verify-and-Edit framework for CoT prompting, which seeks to increase prediction
  factuality by post-editing reasoning chains according to external knowledge. Building
  on top of GPT-3, our framework lead to accuracy improvements in multiple open-domain
  question-answering tasks.
