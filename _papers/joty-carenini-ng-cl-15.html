abstract: 'Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse;
  rather, the relationship between them carries important information that allows
  the discourse to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts.
  Rhetorical analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure. In this article,
  we present CODRA— a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative framework for performing
  Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory, which posits
  a tree representation of a discourse. CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and
  a discourse parser. First, the discourse segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier,
  identifies the elementary discourse units in a given text. Then the discourse parser
  builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities
  inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential parsing and
  the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these
  two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations
  over two different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms
  the state-of-the-art, often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the
  k-best parse hypotheses generated by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy
  even further.
