abstract: 'In this work, we present a method for classifying the quality of blog comments
  using Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This approach is found to yield
  high accuracy on binary classification of high-quality comments, with conversational
  features contributing strongly to the accuracy. We also present a new corpus of
  blog data in conversational form, complete with user-generated quality moderation
  labels from the science and technology news blog Slashdot.
