abstract: 'Transition-based top-down parsing with pointer networks have achieved state-of-the-art
  results in multiple parsing tasks, while having a linear time complexity. However,
  the decoder of these parsers has a sequential structure, which does not yield the
  most appropriate inductive bias for deriving tree structures. In this paper, we
  propose  hierarchical pointer network parsers, and apply them to dependency and
  discourse parsing tasks. Our results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and setting a
  new state-of-the-art in both parsing tasks.
