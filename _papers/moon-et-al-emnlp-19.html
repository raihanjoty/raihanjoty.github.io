abstract: 'Recently, neural approaches to coherence modeling have achieved state-of-the-art
  results in several evaluation tasks. However, we show that most of these models
  often fail on harder tasks with more realistic application scenarios. In particular,
  the existing models underperform on tasks that require the model to be sensitive
  to local contexts such as candidate ranking in conversational dialogue and in machine
  translation. In this paper, we propose a unified coherence model that incorporates
  sentence grammar, inter-sentence coherence relations, and global coherence patterns
  into a common neural framework. With extensive experiments on local and global discrimination
  tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing models by a good
  margin, and establish a new state-of-the-art.
