abstract: 'Morphological inflection is a process of word formation where base words
  are modified to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice,
  person, or number. World Englishes, such as Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) and
  African American Vernacular English (AAVE), differ from Standard English dialects
  in inflection use. Although comprehension by human readers is usually unimpaired
  by non-standard inflection use, NLP systems are not so robust. We introduce a new
  Base-Inflection Encoding of English text that is achieved by combining linguistic
  and statistical techniques. Fine-tuning pre-trained NLP models for downstream tasks
  under this novel encoding achieves robustness to non-standard inflection use while
  maintaining performance on Standard English examples. Models using this encoding
  also generalize better to non-standard dialects without explicit training. We suggest
  metrics to evaluate tokenizers and extensive model-independent analyses demonstrate
  the efficacy of the encoding when used together with data-driven subword tokenizers.
