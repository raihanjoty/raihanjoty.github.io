abstract: 'Question Answering (QA) systems can support health coaches in facilitating
  clients'' lifestyle behavior changes (e.g., in adopting healthy sleep habits). In
  this paper, we formulate a domain-specific QA task for sleep coaching. To this end,
  we release SleepQA, a dataset created from 7,005 passages comprising 4,250 training
  examples with single annotations and 750 examples with 5-way annotations. We train
  a bi-encoder retrieval system on our dataset and perform extensive automated and
  human evaluations of the resulting end-to-end QA system. Comparisons of our model
  with various baselines shows improvements for domain-specific natural language processing
  on real-world questions. We hope that this dataset will lead to wider research interest
  in this important health domain.
