abstract: 'We propose a novel constituency parsing model that casts the parsing problem
  into a series of pointing tasks. Specifically, our model estimates the likelihood
  of a span being a legitimate tree constituent via the pointing score corresponding
  to the boundary words of the span. Our parsing model supports efficient top-down
  decoding and our learning objective is able to enforce structural consistency without
  resorting to the expensive CKY inference. The experiments on the standard English
  Penn Treebank parsing task show that our method achieves 92.78 F1 without using
  pre-trained models, which is higher than all the existing methods with similar time
  complexity. Using pre-trained BERT, our model achieves 95.48 F1, which is competitive
  with the state-of-the-art while being faster. Our approach also establishes new
  state-of-the-art in Basque and Swedish in the SPMRL shared tasks on multilingual
  constituency parsing.
