abstract: 'We describe the systems developed by the team of the Qatar Computing Research
  Institute for the WMT12 Shared Translation Task. We used a phrase-based statistical
  machine translation model with several non-standard settings, most notably tuning
  data selection and phrase table combination. The evaluation results show that we
  rank second in BLEU and TER for Spanish-English, and in the top tier for German-English.
