abstract: 'Huge amounts of textual conversations occur online everyday, where multiple
  conversations take place concurrently. Interleaved conversations lead to difficulties
  in not only following the ongoing discussions but also extracting relevant information
  from simultaneous messages. Conversation disentanglement aims to separate intermingled
  messages into detached conversations. However existing disentanglement methods rely
  mostly on hand-crafted features that are dataset specific, which hinders generalization
  and adaptability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end online framework for conversation
  disentanglement that avoids time-consuming domain-specific feature engineering.
  We design a novel way to embed the whole utterance that comprises timestamp, speaker
  and message text, and propose a custom attention mechanism that models disentanglement
  as a pointing problem while effectively capturing inter-utterance interactions in
  an end-to-end fashion. We also introduce a joint-learning objective to better capture
  contextual information. Our experiments on the Ubuntu IRC dataset show that our
  method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both link and conversation prediction
  tasks.
