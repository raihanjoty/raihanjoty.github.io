abstract: 'Change Captioning is a task that aims to describe the difference between
  images with natural language. Most existing methods treat this problem as a difference
  judgment without the existence of distractors such as viewpoint changes. However,
  in practice, viewpoint changes happen often and can overwhelm the real difference
  to be described. In this paper, we propose a novel visual encoder to explicitly
  distinguish viewpoint changes from real changes in the change captioning task. Moreover,
  we further simulate the attention preference of humans and propose a novel reinforcement
  learning process to fine-tune the attention directly with the language evaluation
  rewards. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
  approaches by a large margin in both Spot-the-Diff and CLEVR-Change datasets.
