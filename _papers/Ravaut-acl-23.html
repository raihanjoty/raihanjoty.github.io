abstract: 'With the rise of task-specific pre-training objectives, abstractive summarization
  models like PEGASUS offer appealing zero-shot performance on downstream summarization
  tasks. However, the performance of such unsupervised models still lags significantly
  behind their supervised counterparts. Similarly to the supervised setup, we notice
  a very high variance in quality among summary candidates from these models whereas
  only one candidate is kept as the summary output. In this paper, we propose to re-rank
  summary candidates in an unsupervised manner, aiming to close the performance gap
  between unsupervised and supervised models. Our approach improves the pre-trained
  unsupervised PEGASUS by 4.37% to 7.27% relative mean ROUGE across four widely-adopted
  summarization benchmarks, and achieves relative gains of 7.51% (up to 23.73% from
  XSum to WikiHow) averaged over 30 transfer setups.
