abstract: 'Our ongoing research addresses the task of finding topics at the sentence
  level in email conversations. We first describe how the existing topic models can
  be applied to this problem. Then we demonstrate why the existing methods are inadequate
  for this task and what more we need to consider. With an experiment we further show
  that conversation structure in the form of fragment quotation graph can be helpful
  for finding topics. To this end, we propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to
  solve the problem. Crucial to our proposed approach is that it captures the rich
  conversation features and integrates the strengths of the supervised approach with
  the unsupervised technique.
