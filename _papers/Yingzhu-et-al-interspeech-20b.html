abstract: 'End-to-end models have been introduced into automatic speech recognition
  (ASR) successfully and achieved superior performance compared with conventional
  hybrid systems, especially with the newly proposed transformer model. However, speaker
  mismatch between training and test data remains a problem, and speaker adaptation
  for transformer model can be further improved. In this paper, we propose to conduct
  speaker aware training for ASR in transformer model. Specifically, we propose to
  embed speaker knowledge through a persistent memory model into speech transformer
  encoder at utterance level. The speaker information is represented by a number of
  static speaker i-vectors, which is concatenated to speech utterance at each encoder
  self-attention layer. Persistent memory is thus formed by carrying speaker information
  through the depth of encoder. The speaker knowledge is captured from self-attention
  between speech and persistent memory vector in encoder. Experiment results on LibriSpeech,
  Switchboard and AISHELL-1 ASR task show that our proposed model brings relative
  4.7%-12.5% word error rate (WER) reductions, and achieves superior results compared
  with other models with the same objective. Furthermore, our model brings relative
  2.1%-8.3% WER reductions compared with the first persistent memory model used in
  ASR.
