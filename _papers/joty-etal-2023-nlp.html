abstract: 'Natural language and visualization (Vis) are two powerful modalities of
  human communication. The goal of this tutorial is to push forward the agenda of
  tightly integrating these two modalities. To this end, the tutorial will introduce
  NLP+Vis with a focus on two main threads of work: \textit(i) NLP for Vis: How to
  develop and adapt state-of-the-art NLP models for solving various visualization
  tasks? and \textit(ii) Vis for NLP: How to leverage visualization techniques to
  interpret and explain complex NLP models effectively? The tutorial will first motivate
  why NLP+Vis is an important area of research and provide an overview of research
  topics on combining NLP and Vis techniques. Then an overview of state-of-the-art
  deep learning models for NLP will be covered. Next, we will provide an overview
  of applying visualization techniques to help make NLP models more interpretable
  and explainable. In the final part, we will focus on various application tasks at
  the intersection of NLP and Vis. We will conclude with an interactive discussion
  of future challenges for NLP+Vis applications. The audience will include researchers
  interested in applying NLP for visualizations as well as others who focus more generally
  at the intersection of machine learning and visualization.
