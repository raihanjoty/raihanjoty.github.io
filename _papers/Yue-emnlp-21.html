abstract: 'Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been
  recently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely benefit
  a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current methods either
  rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is suboptimal for generation
  (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code snippet in the same way as NL, neglecting
  the special characteristics of PL such as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified
  pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics
  conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model is unified in that it
  builds on a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and
  generation tasks, and it employs a unified format of task control codes to allow
  for multi-task learning. We propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training objective
  that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover
  them when they are masked. To further close the gap between the pre-training and
  fine-tuning, we propose a bimodal dual generation task to encourage the alignment
  between NL and PL. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms
  prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection,
  and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL.
  Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information
  from code.
