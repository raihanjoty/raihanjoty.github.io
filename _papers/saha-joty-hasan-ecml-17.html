abstract: 'We present a novel approach to learn distributed representation of sentences
  from unlabeled data by modeling both content and context of a sentence. The content
  model learns sentence representation by predicting its words. On the other hand,
  the context model comprises a neighbor prediction component and a regularizer to
  model distributional and proximity hypotheses, respectively. We propose an online
  algorithm to train the model components jointly. We evaluate the models in a setup,
  where contextual information is available. The experimental results on tasks involving
  classification, clustering, and ranking of sentences show that our model outperforms
  the best existing models by a wide margin across multiple datasets.
