abstract: "Cross-lingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have\
  \ a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer\
  \ learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning cross-lingual\
  \ embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data\
  \ by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has\
  \ shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language\
  \ pairs. In this article,  we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised\
  \ word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable\
  \ training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce\
  \ cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an\
  \ adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement\
  \ procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from\
  \ the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement\
  \ with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with European, non-European\
  \ and low-resource languages from two different datasets show that our method achieves\
  \ better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and\
  \ is also competitive with the supervised system. Along with performing comprehensive\
  \ ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of our\
  \ adversarial model, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the refinement procedures\
  \ to understand their effects. \n"
