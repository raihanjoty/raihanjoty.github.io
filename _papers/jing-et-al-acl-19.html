abstract: 'Claim verification is generally a task of verifying the veracity of a given
  claim, which is critical to many downstream applications. It is cumbersome and inefficient
  for human fact-checkers to find consistent evidences, from which solid verdict could
  be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical
  attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidences as well as
  their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components:
  1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidences considering the claim
  and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends
  on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention;
  and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the the embedded evidences.
  Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model
  outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.
