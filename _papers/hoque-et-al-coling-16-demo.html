abstract: 'We present an interactive system to provide effective and efficient search
  capabilities in Community Question Answering (cQA) forums. The system integrates
  state-of-the-art technology for answer search with a Web-based user interface specifically
  tailored to support the cQA forum readers. The answer search module automatically
  finds relevant answers for a new question by exploring related questions and the
  comments within their threads. The graphical user interface presents the search
  results and supports the exploration of related information. The system is running
  live as a part of the Qatar Living forums.
