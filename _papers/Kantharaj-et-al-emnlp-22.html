abstract: 'Charts are very popular to analyze data and convey important insights.
  People often analyze visualizations to answer open-ended questions that require
  explanatory answers. Answering such questions are often difficult and time-consuming
  as it requires a lot of cognitive and perceptual efforts. To address this challenge,
  we introduce a new task called OpenCQA, where the goal is to answer an open-ended
  question about a chart with descriptive texts. We present the annotation process
  and an in-depth analysis of our dataset. We implement and evaluate a set of baselines
  under three practical settings. In the first setting, a chart and the accompanying
  article is provided as input to the model. The second setting provides only the
  relevant paragraph(s) to the chart instead of the entire article, whereas the third
  setting requires the model to generate an answer solely based on the chart. Our
  analysis of the results show that the top performing models generally produce fluent
  and coherent text while they struggle to perform complex logical and arithmetic
  reasoning.
