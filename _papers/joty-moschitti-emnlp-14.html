abstract: 'In this paper, we present a discriminative approach for reranking discourse
  trees generated by an existing probabilistic discourse parser. The reranker relies
  on tree kernels (TKs) to capture the global dependencies between discourse units
  in a tree. In particular, we design new computational structures of discourse trees,
  which combined with standard TKs, originate novel discourse TKs. The empirical evaluation
  shows that our reranker can improve the state-of-the-art sentence-level parsing
  accuracy from 79.77% to 82.15%, a relative error reduction of 11.8%, which in turn
  pushes the state-of-the-art documentlevel accuracy from 55.8% to 57.3%.
