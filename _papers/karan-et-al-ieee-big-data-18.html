abstract: 'Sleep plays a vital role in human health, both mental and physical. Sleep
  disorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapid increase
  in factors like obesity.  Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with Continuous Positive
  Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is no mechanism to monitor
  a patient''s progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of sleep stages from CPAP flow
  signal is crucial for such a mechanism.  We propose, for the first time, an automated
  sleep staging model based only on the flow signal. Deep neural networks have recently
  shown high accuracy on sleep staging by eliminating handcrafted features. However,
  these methods focus exclusively on extracting informative features from the input
  signal, without paying much attention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output
  sequence.  We propose an end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution
  and recurrent neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal
  with a structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the
  temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous
  methods by 10\% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep staging
  deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to accurately track
  sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages that can be deployed
  for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on sleep apnea patients. Apart from
  the technical contributions, we expect this study to motivate new research questions
  in sleep science.
