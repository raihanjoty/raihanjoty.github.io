abstract: 'We present BotSIM, a data-efficient end-to-end Bot SIMulation framework
  for commercial task-oriented  dialog (TOD) systems. BotSIM consists of three major
  components: 1) a Generator that can infer semantic-level dialog acts and entities
  from bot definitions and generate conversations via model-based paraphrasing; 2)
  an agenda-based dialog user Simulator to communicate with the dialog agents; 3)
  a Remediator to analyze and visualize the bot health reports and provide actionable
  remediation suggestions for troubleshooting and improving the dialog system.   We
  demonstrate BotSIM''s effectiveness in end-to-end evaluation, remediation and multi-intent
  dialog generation via case studies on two commercial bot platforms. BotSIM''s "generation-simulation-remediation''"
  paradigm accelerates the end-to-end bot evaluation and iteration process by: 1)
  reducing the effort needed to create test cases; 2) enabling a better understanding
  of both NLU and end-to-end performance via extensive dialog simulation; 3) improving
  the bot troubleshooting  process with actionable suggestions from simulation results
  analysis. A demo of our system can be found at  https://tinyurl.com/mryu74cd and
  a demo video at https://youtu.be/qLPJm6_UOKY.
