abstract: 'Data augmentation techniques have been widely used to improve machine learning
  performance. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate high quality synthetic
  data for low-resource tagging tasks with language models, where the language model
  is trained with the linearized labeled sentences. Our method is applicable to both
  supervised and semi-supervised settings. For the supervised setting, we conduct
  extensive experiments on named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) and
  end-to-end target based sentiment analysis (E2E-TBSA) tasks. While for the semi-supervised
  setting, we evaluate our method on the NER task under the conditions of given unlabeled
  data only and unlabeled data plus a knowledge base. The results show that our method
  can consistently outperform the baselines, particularly when the given gold training
  data are less.
