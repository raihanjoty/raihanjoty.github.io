abstract: 'We introduce a novel top-down end-to-end formulation of document level
  discourse parsing in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework. In this formulation,
  we consider discourse parsing as a sequence of splitting decisions at token boundaries
  and use a seq2seq network to model the splitting decisions. Our framework facilitates
  discourse parsing from scratch without requiring discourse segmentation as a prerequisite;
  rather, it yields segmentation as part of the parsing process. Our unified parsing
  model adopts a beam search to decode the best tree structure by searching through
  a space of high scoring trees. With extensive experiments on the standard RST discourse
  treebank, we demonstrate that our parser outperforms existing methods by a good
  margin in both end-to-end parsing and parsing with gold segmentation. More importantly,
  it does so without using any handcrafted features, making it faster and easily adaptable
  to new languages and domains.
