abstract: 'We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language
  of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the forum.
  In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a kernel-based
  system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a large parallel corpus
  is available for training a machine translation system, bilingual dictionaries,
  and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that both approaches degrade the
  performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based
  system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using
  a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English
  trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance
  gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the
  parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent
  the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results
  also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel
  system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.
