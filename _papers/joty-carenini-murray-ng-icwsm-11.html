abstract: 'We propose a graph-theoretic supervised topic segmentation model for email
  conversations which combines (i) lexical knowledge, (ii) conversational features,
  and (iii) topic features. We compare our results with the existing unsupervised
  models (i.e., LCSeg and LDA), and with their two extensions for email conversations
  (i.e., LCSeg+FQG and LDA+FQG) that not only use lexical information but also exploit
  finer conversation structure. Empirical evaluation shows that our supervised model
  is the best performer and achieves highest accuracy by combining the three different
  knowledge sources, where knowledge about the conversation has proved to be the most
  important indicator for segmenting emails.
