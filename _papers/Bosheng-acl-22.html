abstract: 'Over the last few years, there has been a move towards data curation for
  multilingual task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems that can serve people speaking
  different languages. However, existing multilingual ToD datasets either have a limited
  coverage of languages due to the high cost of data curation, or ignore the fact
  that dialogue entities barely exist in countries speaking these languages. To tackle
  these limitations, we introduce a novel data curation method that generates GlobalWoZ
  -- a large-scale multilingual ToD dataset globalized from an English ToD dataset
  for three unexplored use cases of  multilingual ToD systems. Our method is based
  on translating dialogue templates and filling them with local entities in the target-language
  countries. Besides, we extend the coverage of target languages to 20 languages.
  We will release our dataset and a set of strong baselines to encourage research
  on multilingual ToD systems for real use cases.
