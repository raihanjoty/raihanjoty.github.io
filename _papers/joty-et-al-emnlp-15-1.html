abstract: 'We present novel models for domain adaptation based on the neural network
  joint model (NNJM). Our models maximize the cross entropy by regularizing the loss
  function with respect to in-domain model. Domain adaptation is carried out by assigning
  higher weight to out-domain sequences that are similar to the in-domain data. In
  our alternative model we take a more restrictive approach by additionally penalizing
  sequences similar to the outdomain data. Our models achieve better perplexities
  than the baseline NNJM models and give improvements of up to 0.5 and 0.6 BLEU points
  in Arabic-to-English and English-to-German language pairs, on a standard task of
  translating TED talks.
