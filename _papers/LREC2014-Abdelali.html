abstract: 'This paper presents the AMARA corpus of on-line educational content: a
  new parallel corpus of educational video subtitles, multilingually aligned for 20
  languages, i.e. 20 monolingual corpora and 190 parallel corpora. This corpus includes
  both resource-rich languages such as English and Arabic, and resource-poor languages
  such as Hindi and Thai. In this paper, we describe the gathering, validation, and
  preprocessing of a large collection of parallel, community-generated subtitles.
  Furthermore, we describe the methodology used to prepare the data for Machine Translation
  tasks. Additionally, we provide a document-level, jointly aligned development and
  test sets for 14 language pairs, designed for tuning and testing Machine Translation
  systems. We provide baseline results for these tasks, and highlight some of the
  challenges we face when building machine translation systems for educational content.
