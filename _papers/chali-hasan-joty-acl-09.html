abstract: 'In this paper, we analyze the impact of different automatic annotation
  methods on the performance of supervised approaches to the complex question answering
  problem (defined in the DUC-2007 main task). Huge amount of annotated or labeled
  data is a prerequisite for supervised training. The task of labeling can be accomplished
  either by humans or by computer programs. When humans are employed, the whole process
  becomes time consuming and expensive. So, in order to produce a large set of labeled
  data we prefer the automatic annotation strategy. We apply five different automatic
  annotation techniques to produce labeled data using ROUGE similarity measure, Basic
  Element (BE) overlap, syntactic similarity measure, semantic similarity measure,
  and Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESSK). The representative supervised methods
  we use are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Hidden
  Markov Models (HMM), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Evaluation results are presented
  to show the impact.
