abstract: 'We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency
  parsing problems (syntactic and discourse parsing) into a series of conditional
  splitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability distribution
  of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports efficient top-down
  decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The conditional splitting formulation
  together with efficient beam search inference facilitate structural consistency
  without relying on expensive structured inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis
  we show that in our formulation, discourse segmentation can be framed as a special
  case of parsing which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring  segmentation
  as a pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the
  standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained representations
  and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more computationally expensive
  than ours. In discourse parsing, our method outperforms SoTA by a good margin. Our
  source code will be publicly available.
