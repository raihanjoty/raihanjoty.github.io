abstract: 'We study the task of span-level Emotion cause analysis (SECA), which is
  focused on extracting the specific emotion cause span(s) for a certain emotion expressed
  in the given context. Compared to popular clause-level emotion cause analysis (CECA),
  it is a finer-grained emotion cause analysis (ECA) task. The existing SECA method
  heavily dependents on the effectiveness of designed features, which is labor-intensive
  and not generalized well. In this paper, we formalize SECA as a sequence tagging
  task for which several variants of neural network-based sequence tagging models
  to extract specific emotion cause span(s) in the given context. These models combine
  different types of encoding and decoding approaches. Furthermore, to make our models
  more ``emotionally sensitive'''', we utilize the multi-head attention mechanism
  to enhance the representation of context. Experimental evaluations conducted on
  two benchmark datasets show that our proposed models create new state-of-the-art
  results. Our work is the first using neural sequence tagging method for span-level
  ECA.
