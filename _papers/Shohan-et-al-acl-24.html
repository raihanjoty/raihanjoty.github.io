abstract: 'Millions of news articles published online daily can overwhelm readers.
  Headlines and tags are essential for guiding readers to decide if the content is
  worth their time. While headline generation has been extensively studied, tag generation
  remains largely unexplored, yet it offers readers better access to topics of interest.
  The need for conciseness in capturing readers'' attention necessitates improved
  content selection strategies for identifying salient and relevant segments within
  lengthy articles, thereby guiding language models effectively. To address this,
  we leverage auxiliary information such as images and captions embedded in the articles
  to retrieve sentences and utilize instruction tuning with variations to generate
  both headlines and tags for news articles in a multilingual context. To make use
  of the auxiliary information, we have compiled a dataset named XL-HeadTags, which
  includes 20 languages across 6 diverse language families. Through extensive evaluation,
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play multimodal retrievers for
  both tasks. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools for processing and
  evaluating multilingual texts, significantly contributing to the research community
  by enabling more accurate and efficient analysis across languages.
