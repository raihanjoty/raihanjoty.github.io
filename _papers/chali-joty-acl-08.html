abstract: 'We consider the problem of answering complex questions that require inferencing
  and synthesizing information from multiple documents and can be seen as a kind of
  topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. The stochastic, graph-based
  method for computing the relative importance of textual units (i.e. sentences) is
  very successful in generic summarization. In this method, a sentence is encoded
  as a vector in which each component represents the occurrence frequency (TF*IDF)
  of a word. However, the major limitation of the TF*IDF approach is that it only
  retains the frequency of the words and does not take into account the sequence,
  syntactic and semantic information. In this paper, we study the impact of syntactic
  and shallow semantic information in the graph-based method for answering complex
  questions.
