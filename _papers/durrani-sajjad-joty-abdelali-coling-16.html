abstract: 'We present a novel fusion model for domain adaptation in Statistical Machine
  Translation. Our model is based on the joint source-target neural network (Devlin
  et al., 2014), and is learned by fusing in- and out-domain models. The adaptation
  is performed by backpropagating errors from the output layer to the word embedding
  layer of each model, subsequently adjusting parameters of the composite model towards
  the in-domain data. On the standard tasks of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English
  TED talks, we observed average improvements of +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively
  over a competition grade phrase-based system. We also demonstrate improvements over
  existing adaptation methods.
