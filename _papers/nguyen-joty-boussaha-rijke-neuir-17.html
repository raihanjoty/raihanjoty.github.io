abstract: 'Discussion forums are an important source of information. They are often
  used to answer specific questions a user might have and to discover more about a
  topic of interest. Discussions in these forums may evolve in intricate ways, making
  it difficult for users to follow the flow of ideas. We propose a novel approach
  for automatically identifying the underlying thread structure of a forum discussion.
  Our approach is based on a neural model that computes coherence scores of possible
  reconstructions and then selects the highest scoring, i.e., the most coherent one.
  Preliminary experiments demonstrate promising results outperforming a number of
  strong baseline methods.
