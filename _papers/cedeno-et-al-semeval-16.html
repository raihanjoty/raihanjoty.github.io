abstract: 'We describe our system, ConvKN, participating to the SemEval-2016 Task
  3 " Community Question Answering ". The task targeted the reranking of questions
  and comments in real-life web fora both in English and Arabic. ConvKN combines convolutional
  tree kernels with convolutional neural networks and additional manually designed
  features including text similarity and thread specific features. For the first time,
  we applied tree kernels to syntactic trees of Arabic sentences for a reranking task.
  Our approaches obtained the second best results in three out of four tasks. The
  only task we performed averagely is the one where we did not use tree kernels in
  our classifier.
