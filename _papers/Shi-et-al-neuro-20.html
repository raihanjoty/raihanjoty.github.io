abstract: 'The explosion of video data on the Internet requires effective and efficient
  technology to generate captions automatically for people, especially those who are
  visually im- paired. Despite the great progress of video captioning research, particularly
  in video feature encoding, the language decoder is still largely based on the prevailing
  recurrent structure such as LSTM, which tends to prefer frequent words that align
  with the video and do not generalize well to new videos. In this paper, we propose
  a boundary-aware hierarchical language decoder for video captioning, which consists
  of a high-level de- coder, working as a global (caption-level) language model, and
  a low-level decoder, working as a local (phrase-level) language model. Most importantly,
  we introduce a binary gate into the low-level language decoder to detect the phrasal
  boundaries. To- gether with other advanced components including a joint video prediction
  module, a shared soft attention, and a boundary-aware video encoding module, our
  integrated video captioning framework can discover hierarchical language information
  and dis- tinguish the subjects from the objects of the verbs in a sentence, which
  are usually confusing during caption generation. Extensive experiments on two widely-used
  video captioning datasets, MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT) and YouTube-to-Text (MSVD),
  show that our method is highly competitive, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
