abstract: 'Interpretability and efficiency are two important considerations for the
  adoption of neural automatic metrics. In this work, we develop strong-performing
  automatic metrics for reference-based summarization evaluation, based on a two-stage
  evaluation pipeline that first extracts basic information units from one text sequence
  and then checks the extracted units in another sequence. The metrics we developed
  include two-stage metrics that can provide high interpretability at both the fine-grained
  unit level and summary level, and one-stage metrics that achieve a balance between
  efficiency and interoperability. We make the developed tools publicly available
  through a Python package and GitHub.
