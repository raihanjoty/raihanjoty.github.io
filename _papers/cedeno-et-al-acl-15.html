abstract: 'Community Question Answering (cQA) is a new application of QA in social
  contexts (e.g., fora). It presents new interesting challenges and research directions,
  e.g., exploiting the dependencies between the different comments of a thread to
  select the best answer for a given question. In this paper, we explored two ways
  of modeling such dependencies: (i) by designing specific features looking globally
  at the thread; and (ii) by applying structure prediction models. We trained and
  evaluated our models on data from SemEval-2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in cQA.
  Our experiments show that: (i) the thread-level features consistently improve the
  performance for a variety of machine learning models, yielding state-of-the-art
  results; and (ii) sequential dependencies between the answer labels captured by
  structured prediction models are not enough to improve the results, indicating that
  more information is needed in the joint model.
