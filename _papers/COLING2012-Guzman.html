abstract: 'abstract = {We present a framework for the analysis of Machine Translation
  performance. We use multivariate linear models to determine the impact of a wide
  range of features on translation performance. Our assumption is that variables that
  most contribute to predict translation performance are the key to understand the
  differences between good and bad translations. During training, we learn the regression
  parameters that better predict translation quality using a wide range of input features
  based on the translation model and the first-best translation hypotheses. We use
  a linear regression with regularization. Our results indicate that with regularized
  linear regression, we can achieve higher levels of correlation between our predicted
  values and the actual values of the quality metrics. Our analysis shows that the
  performance for in-domain data is largely dependent on the characteristics of the
  translation model. On the other hand, out-of domain data can benefit from better
  reordering strategies.
