abstract: "We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural\
  \ networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation\
  \ from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework,\
  \ lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses\
  \ is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer\
  \ neural network that models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses\
  \ and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. We experiment with the\
  \ benchmark datasets from the \\WMT\\ Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the\
  \ best results published so far, with the basic network configuration. We also perform\
  \ a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different\
  \ components of the network. We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning\
  \ of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional\
  \ and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible\
  \ and generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an\
  \ \\MT\\ evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with\
  \ the state of the art. \n"
