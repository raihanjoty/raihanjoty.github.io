abstract: 'We explore neural joint models for the task of domain adaptation in machine
  translation in two ways: (i) we apply state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques,
  such as mixture modelling and data selection using the recently proposed Neural
  Network Joint Model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014); (ii) we propose two novel approaches
  to perform adaptation through instance weighting and weight readjustment in the
  NNJM framework. In our first approach, we propose a pair of models called Neural
  Domain Adaptation Models (NDAM) that minimizes the cross entropy by regularizing
  the loss function with respect to in-domain (and optionally to out-domain) model.
  In the second approach, we present a set of Neural Fusion Models (NFM) that combines
  the in- and the out-domain models by readjusting their parameters based on the in-domain
  data. We evaluated our models on the standard task of translating English-to-German
  and Arabic-to-English TED talks. The NDAM models achieved better perplexities and
  modest BLEU improvements compared to the baseline NNJM, trained either on in-domain
  or on a concatenation of in- and out-domain data. On the other hand, the NFM models
  obtained significant improvements of up to +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively.
  We also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods such as instance
  weighting, phrasetable fill-up, linear and log-linear interpolations.
