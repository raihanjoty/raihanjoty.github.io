abstract: 'Image captioning is a multimodal task involving computer vision and natural
  language processing, where the goal is to learn a mapping from the image to its
  natural language description. In general, the mapping function is learned from a
  training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption
  paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image
  captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the
  characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align
  it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English)
  parallel corpus. We evaluate our method on two image-to-English benchmark datasets:
  MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative comparisons against several baseline approaches
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
