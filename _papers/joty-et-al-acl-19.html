abstract: 'Discourse processing is a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks
  to uncover linguistic structures from texts at several levels, which can support
  many downstream applications. This involves identifying the topic structure, the
  coherence structure, the coreference structure, and the conversation structure for
  conversational discourse. Taken together, these structures can inform text summarization,
  machine translation, essay scoring, sentiment analysis,  information extraction,
  question answering, and thread recovery. The tutorial starts with an overview of
  basic concepts in discourse analysis - monologue vs. conversation, synchronous vs.
  asynchronous conversation, and key linguistic structures in discourse analysis.
  We also give an overview of linguistic structures and corresponding discourse analysis
  tasks that discourse researchers are generally interested in, as well as key applications
  on which these discourse structures have an impact.
