abstract: 'This paper describes QCRI’s participation in SemEval-2015 Task 3 “Answer
  Selection in Community Question Answering”, which targeted real-life Web forums,
  and was offered in both Arabic and English. We apply a supervised machine learning
  approach considering a manifold of features including among others word n-grams,
  text similarity, sentiment analysis, the presence of specific words, and the context
  of a comment. Our approach was the best performing one in the Arabic subtask and
  the third best in the two English subtasks.
