abstract: 'We present novel automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation that
  use discourse structure and convolution kernels to compare the discourse tree of
  an automatic translation with that of the human reference. We experiment with five
  transformations and augmentations of a base discourse tree representation based
  on the rhetorical structure theory, and we combine the kernel scores for each of
  them into a single score. Finally, we add other metrics from the ASIYA MT evaluation
  toolkit, and we tune the weights of the combination on actual human judgments. Experiments
  on the WMT12 and WMT13 metrics shared task datasets show correlation with human
  judgments that outperforms what the best systems that participated in these years
  achieved, both at the segment and at the system level.
