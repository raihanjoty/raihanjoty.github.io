abstract: 'Despite the efforts in 70+ years in all aspects of Entity res- olution
  (ER), there is still a high demand for democratizing ER – by reducing the heavy
  human involvement in label- ing data, performing feature engineering, tuning parameters,
  and defining blocking functions. With the recent advances in deep learning, in particular
  distributed representations of words (a.k.a. word embeddings), we present a novel
  ER sys- tem, called DeepER, that achieves good accuracy, high effi- ciency, as well
  as ease-of-use (i.e., much less human efforts). We use sophisticated composition
  methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long
  short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation
  (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities
  be- tween tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are
  available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune
  the distributed representations that are customized for a specific ER task under
  different scenarios. We propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking
  approach that takes all at- tributes of a tuple into consideration and produces
  much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that con- sider only a few
  attributes. We evaluate our algorithms on multiple datasets (including benchmarks,
  biomedical data, as well as multi-lingual data) and the extensive experimental results
  show that DeepER outperforms existing solutions.
