abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have become the norm in natural language processing
  (NLP), excelling in few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with their remarkable abilities.
  Nonetheless, the success of ICL largely hinges on the choice of few-shot demonstration
  examples, making the selection process increasingly crucial. Existing methods have
  delved into optimizing the quantity and semantic similarity of these examples to
  improve ICL performances. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that the
  effectiveness of ICL is limited by the length of the input context. Moreover, varying
  combinations of few-shot demonstration examples can significantly boost accuracy
  across different test samples. To address this, we propose a novel method named
  parallel in-context learning (ParaICL) that effectively utilizes all demonstration
  examples without exceeding the manageable input context length. ParaICL employs
  parallel batching to distribute demonstration examples into different batches according
  to the semantic similarities of the questions in the demonstrations to the test
  question. It then computes normalized batch semantic scores for each batch. A weighted
  average semantic objective, constrained by adaptive plausibility, is applied to
  select the most appropriate tokens. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
  effectiveness of ParaICL and conduct ablation studies to underscore its design rationale.
  We further demonstrate that ParaICL can seamlessly integrate with existing methods.
