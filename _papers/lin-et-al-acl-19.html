abstract: 'We propose an efficient neural framework for sentence-level discourse analysis
  in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Our framework comprises a
  discourse segmenter to identify the elementary discourse units (EDU) in a text,
  and a discourse parser that constructs a discourse tree in a top-down fashion. Both
  the segmenter and the parser are based on Pointer Networks and operate in linear
  time. Our segmenter yields an F1 score of 95.4, and our parser achieves an F1 score
  of 81.7 on the aggregated labeled (relation) metric, surpassing previous approaches
  by a good margin and approaching human agreement on both tasks (98.3 and 83.0 F1)
