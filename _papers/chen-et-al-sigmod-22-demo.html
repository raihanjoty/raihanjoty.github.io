abstract: 'The database systems course in an undergraduate computer science degree
  program is gaining increasing importance due to the con- tinuous supply of database-related
  jobs as well as the rise of Data Science. A key learning goal of learners taking
  such a course is to understand how sql queries are executed in an rdbms in practice.
  Existing rdbms typically expose a query execution plan (qep) in visual or textual
  format, which describes the execution steps for a given query. However, it is often
  daunting for a learner to compre- hend these qeps containing vendor-specific implementation
  details. In this demonstration, we present a novel, generic, and portable system
  called lantern that generates a natural language-based description of the execution
  strategy chosen by the underlying rdbms to process a query. It provides a declarative
  framework called pool for subject matter experts (sme) to efficiently create and
  ma- nipulate natural language descriptions of physical operators of any rdbms. It
  then exploits pool to generate nl description of a qep by integrating rule-based
  and deep learning-based techniques to infuse language variability in the descriptions.
  Such nl generation strategy mitigates the impact of boredom on learners caused by
  repeated exposure of similar text generated by rule-based systems.
