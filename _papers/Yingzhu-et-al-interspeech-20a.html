abstract: 'Transformer model has made great progress in speech recognition. However,
  compared with models with iterative computation, transformer model has fixed encoder
  and decoder depth, thus losing the recurrent inductive bias. Besides, finding the
  optimal number of layers involves trial-and-error attempts. In this paper, the universal
  speech transformer is proposed, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first
  work to use universal transformer for speech recognition. It generalizes the speech
  transformer with dynamic numbers of encoder/decoder layers, which can relieve the
  burden of tuning depth related hyperparameters. Universal transformer adds the depth
  and positional embeddings repeatedly for each layer, which dilutes the acoustic
  information carried by hidden representation, and it also performs a partial update
  of hidden vectors between layers, which is less efficient especially on the very
  deep models. For better use of universal transformer, we modify its processing framework
  by removing the depth embedding and only adding the positional embedding once at
  transformer encoder frontend. Furthermore, to update the hidden vectors efficiently,
  especially on the very deep models, we adopt a full update. Experiments on LibriSpeech,
  Switchboard and AISHELL-1 datasets show that our model outperforms a baseline by
  3.88%-13.7%, and surpasses other model with less computation cost.
