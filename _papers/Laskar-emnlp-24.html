abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention
  due to their remarkable capabilities in performing diverse tasks across various
  domains. However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying
  them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite
  the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity
  of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies
  in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary
  challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations
  in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our
  perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable,
  and robust.
