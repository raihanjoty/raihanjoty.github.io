abstract: 'Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
  Depending on the levels of granularity, the task can be defined as segmenting a
  document into topical segments, or segmenting a sentence into elementary discourse
  units. Traditional solutions to the two tasks heavily rely on carefully designed
  features. The recently proposed neural models do not need manual feature engineering,
  but they either suffer from sparse boundary tags or they cannot well handle the
  issue of variable size output vocabulary. Our generic end-to-end segmentation model,
  named SEGBOT, uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network to encode input text
  sequence. The model then uses another recurrent neural network together with a pointer
  network to select text boundaries in the input sequence. In this way, SEGBOT does
  not require hand-crafted features. More importantly, our model inherently handles
  the issue of variable size output vocabulary and the issue of sparse boundary tags.
  In our experiments, SEGBOT outperforms state-of-the-art models on two tasks, document-level
  topic segmentation and sentence-level discourse segmentation.
