abstract: 'While participants in a multi-party multi-turn conversation simultaneously
  engage in multiple conversation topics, existing response selection methods are
  developed mainly focusing on a two-party single-conversation scenario. Hence, the
  prolongation and transition of conversation topics are ignored by current methods.
  In this work, we frame response selection as a dynamic topic tracking task to match
  the topic between the response and relevant conversation context. With this new
  formulation, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that supports efficient
  encoding through large pretrained models with only two utterances at once to perform
  dynamic topic disentanglement and response selection. We also propose Topic-BERT
  an essential pretraining step to embed topic information into BERT with self-supervised
  learning. Experimental results on the DSTC-8 Ubuntu IRC dataset show state-of-the-art
  results in response selection and topic disentanglement tasks outperforming existing
  methods by a good margin.
