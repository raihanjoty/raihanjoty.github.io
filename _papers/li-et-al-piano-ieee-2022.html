abstract: 'Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem
  has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM, which
  is NP-hard, is to select a set of k users known as seed users who can influence
  the most individuals in the social network. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate
  the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number
  of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular
  threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result
  quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing
  efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address
  the IM problem by leveraging deep reinforcement learning to estimate the expected
  influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called PIANO that incorporates
  network embedding and reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem.
  In order to make it practical, we further present PIANO-E and PIANO@⟨d⟩, both of
  which can be applied directly to answer IM without training the model from scratch.
  Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that PIANO achieves the best
  performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-
  art classical solutions. We also demonstrate that the learned parametric models
  generalize well across different networks. Besides, we provide a pool of pretrained
  PIANO models such that any IM task can be addressed by directly applying a model
  from the pool without training over the targeted network.
