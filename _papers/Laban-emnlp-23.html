abstract: 'With the recent appearance of LLMs in practical settings, having methods
  that can effectively detect factual inconsistencies is crucial to reduce the propagation
  of misinformation and improve trust in model outputs. When testing on existing factual
  consistency benchmarks, we find that a few large language models (LLMs) perform
  competitively on classification benchmarks for factual inconsistency detection compared
  to traditional non-LLM methods. However, a closer analysis reveals issues with existing
  evaluation benchmarks, affecting evaluation precision. To address this, we propose
  a new protocol for inconsistency detection benchmark creation and implement it in
  a 10-domain benchmark called SummEdits. This new benchmark is 20 times more cost-effective
  per sample than previous benchmarks and highly reproducible, as we estimate inter-annotator
  agreement at about 0.9. Most LLMs struggle on SummEdits, with performance close
  to random chance. The best-performing model, GPT-4, is still 8% below estimated
  human performance, highlighting the gaps in LLMs'' ability to reason about facts
  and detect inconsistencies when they occur.
