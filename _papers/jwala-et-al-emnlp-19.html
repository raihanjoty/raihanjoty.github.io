abstract: 'The ongoing neural revolution in machine translation has made it easier
  to model larger contexts beyond the sentence-level, which can potentially help resolve
  some discourse-level ambiguities such as pronominal anaphora, thus enabling better
  translations. Unfortunately, even when the resulting improvements are seen as substantial
  by humans, they remain Punta Cana, Dominican Republicly unnoticed by traditional
  automatic evaluation measures like BLEU, as only a few words end up being affected.
  Thus, specialized evaluation measures are needed. With this aim in mind, we contribute
  an extensive, targeted dataset that can be used as a test suite for pronoun translation,
  covering multiple source languages and different pronoun errors drawn from real
  system translations, for English. We further propose an evaluation measure to differentiate
  good and bad pronoun translations. We also conduct a user study to report correlations
  with human judgments.
