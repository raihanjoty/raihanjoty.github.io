abstract: 'We describe the Arabic-English and English-Arabic statistical machine translation
  systems developed by the Qatar Computing Research Institute for the IWSLT’2013 evaluation
  campaign on spoken language translation. We used one phrase-based and two hierarchical
  decoders, exploring various settings thereof. We further experimented with three
  domain adaptation methods, and with various Arabic word segmentation schemes. Combining
  the output of several systems yielded a gain of up to 3.4 BLEU points over the baseline.
  Here we also describe a specialized normalization scheme for evaluating Arabic output,
  which was adopted for the IWSLT’2013 evaluation campaign.
