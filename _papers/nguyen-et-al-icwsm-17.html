abstract: 'The role of social media, in particular microblogging platforms such as
  Twitter, as a conduit for actionable and tactical information during disasters is
  increasingly acknowledged. However, time-critical analysis of big crisis data on
  social media streams brings challenges to machine learning techniques, especially
  the ones that use supervised learning. The scarcity of labeled data, particularly
  in the early hours of a crisis, delays the learning process. Existing classification
  methods require a significant amount of labeled data specific to a particular event
  for training plus a lot of feature engineering to achieve best results. In this
  work, we introduce neural network based classification methods for identifying useful
  tweets during a crisis situation. At the onset of a disaster when no labeled data
  is available, our proposed method makes the best use of the out-of-event data and
  achieves good results.
