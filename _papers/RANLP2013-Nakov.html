abstract: 'Research on statistical machine translation has focused on particular translation
  directions, typically with English as the target language, e.g., from Arabic to
  English. When we reverse the translation direction, the multiple reference translations
  turn into multiple possible inputs, which offers both challenges and opportunities.
  We propose and evaluate several strategies for making use of these multiple inputs:
  (a) select one of the datasets, (b) select the best input for each sentence, and
  (c) synthesize an input for each sentence by fusing the available inputs. Surprisingly,
  we find out that it is best to tune on the hardest available input, not on the one
  that yields the highest BLEU score. This finding has implications on how to pick
  good translators and how to select useful data for parameter optimization in SMT.
