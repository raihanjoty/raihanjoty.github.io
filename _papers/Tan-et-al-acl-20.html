abstract: 'Training on only perfect Standard English cor- pora predisposes pre-trained
  neural networks to discriminate against minorities from non- standard linguistic
  backgrounds. We perturb the inflectional morphology of words to craft plausible
  and semantically similar adversarial examples that expose these biases in popu-
  lar models, e.g., BERT and Transformer, and show that adversarially finetuning them
  for a single epoch significantly improves robustness without sacrificing performance
  on clean data.
