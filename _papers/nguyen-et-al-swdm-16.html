abstract: 'During natural or man-made disasters, humanitarian response organizations
  look for useful information to support their decision-making processes. Social media
  platforms such as Twitter have been considered as a vital source of useful information
  for disaster response and management. Despite advances in natural language processing
  techniques, processing short and informal Twitter messages is a challenging task.
  In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address two types
  of information needs of response organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets
  and 2) classifying them into topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation
  of words and learn the representation as well as higher level features automatically
  for the classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic
  gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations.
  We test our models using a crisis-related real-world Twitter dataset.
