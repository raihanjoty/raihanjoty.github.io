abstract: 'Topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for
  higher-level conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many Natural
  Language Processing (NLP) applications. We present two new corpora of email and
  blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability for
  the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose
  a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous
  conversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grained
  structure of an asynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features
  by applying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose
  two novel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational structure,
  and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical, conversational
  and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel (unsupervised) random
  walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different
  sources: the leading sentences and the fine-grained conversational structure. Empirical
  evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models
  beat the state-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations.
