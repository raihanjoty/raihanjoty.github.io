abstract: 'Monitoring patients in ICU is a challenging and high-cost task. Hence,
  predicting the condition of patients during their ICU stay can help provide better
  acute care and plan the hospital''s resources. There has been continuous progress
  in machine learning research for ICU management, and most of this work has focused
  on using time series signals recorded by ICU instruments. In our work, we show that
  adding clinical notes as another modality improves the performance of the model
  for three benchmark tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, modeling decompensation,
  and length of stay forecasting that play an important role in ICU management. While
  the time-series data is measured at regular intervals, doctor notes are charted
  at irregular times, making it challenging to model them together. We propose a method
  to model them jointly, achieving considerable improvement across benchmark tasks
  over baseline time-series model.
