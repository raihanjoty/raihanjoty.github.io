abstract: 'Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information
  from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document
  summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version
  of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information. In this paper,
  we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine
  learning techniques: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative
  importance of the sentences. We compare the results of these approaches. Our experiments
  show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and EM performs
  better than K-means. However, the performance of these approaches depends entirely
  on the feature set used and the weighting of these features. In order to measure
  the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features
  (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based
  syntactic and shallow-semantic) for each of the document sentences. We use a local
  search technique to learn the weights of the features. To the best of our knowledge,
  no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntactic/semantic information
  for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences
  and the document sentences in order to generate query-focused summaries (or answers
  to complex questions). For each of our methods of generating summaries (i.e. empirical,
  K-means and EM) we show the effects of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over
  the bag-of-words (BOW) features.
