abstract: 'The widespread usage of rdbms in the commercial world has played a pivotal
  role in the offering of database systems course in major universities. A key challenge
  encountered by learners taking such a course is the topic of query optimization.
  The query optimization process produces a query execution plan (qep), which represents
  an execution strategy for an sql query. Unfortunately, in practice, it is often
  difficult for a learner to comprehend query execution strategies by perusing vendor-specific
  qeps, hindering her learning process. In this paper, we present a novel, end-to-end,
  generic sys- tem called lantern that generates a natural language description of
  a qep to enhance its understanding. It takes as input an sql query and its qep,
  and generates a natural language description of the execution strategy deployed
  by the underlying rdbms. Specifi- cally, it deploys a declarative framework called
  pool that enables subject matter experts to efficiently create and maintain natural
  language descriptions of physical operators used in qeps. A rule- based framework
  called rule-lantern is proposed that exploits pool to generate natural language
  descriptions of qeps. Despite the high accuracy of rule-lantern, our engagement
  with learners reveal that consistent with existing psychology theories perusing
  such rule-based descriptions lead to boredom due to repetitive state- ments across
  different qeps. To address this issue, we present a novel deep learning-based language
  generation framework called neural-lantern that infuses language variability in
  the gener- ated description by exploiting a set of paraphrasing tools and word embedding.
  Our experimental study with real learners shows the effectiveness of lantern in
  facilitating comprehension of qeps.
