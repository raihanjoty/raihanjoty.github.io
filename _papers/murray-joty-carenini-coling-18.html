abstract: 'The primary goal of this tutorial is for attendees to learn about recent
  work applying NLP to spoken and written conversations, with a focus on computational
  models for three related topics: conversational structure, summarization and sentiment
  detection, and group dynamics. We provide examples of specific NLP tasks within
  those three areas, how they relate to one another, their applications, and how we
  evaluate task performance. We will begin by discussing motivations and applications
  of applying NLP methods to conversations, including downstream applications that
  could benefit. Attendees will hear about the challenges of working with noisy data,
  and examples of datasets of spoken and/or written conversations. The first part
  of the tutorial covers conversational structures, the basic building blocks for
  working with conversational data. Participants will learn about computational methods
  for uncovering thread and topic structures of a conversation, detecting dialogue
  acts and adjacency pairs, identifying participant roles (where relevant), and how
  to treat disfluencies. We will cover methods for both synchronous (e.g., meeting,
  phone) and asynchronous (e.g., forum, email) conversations. In the second part of
  the tutorial, we will focus on sentiment analysis and summarization. Attendees will
  learn about the related, overlapping tasks of detecting sentiment, subjectivity,
  and opinions. We will cover unsupervised and supervised approaches, as well as multimodal
  sentiment detection. Participants will learn about intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation
  of sentiment analysis methods for conversations. For summarization, we will cover
  core topics, such as the notions of extractive vs. abstractive summarization, and
  summarization vs. compression. In particular, participants will learn about the
  limits of extractive summarization on noisy and opinion-filled conversation data.
  We will particularly emphasize the question of how to evaluate automatically generated
  summaries, including some of the controversial history surrounding automatic summarization
  metrics that are widely used. In the final part of the tutorial, participants will
  learn about the growing field of research that uses NLP and machine learning methods
  to model and predict group dynamics, including prediction of group performance and
  participant affect. Attendees will learn about the close relationship between these
  three areas of summarization, sentiment, and group dynamics, and why researchers
  in each one of those areas often end up being concerned with the other two topics
  as well. Finally, we will discuss promising current and future directions of applying
  NLP to conversations.
