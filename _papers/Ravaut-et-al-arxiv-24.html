abstract: 'With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, new opportunities
  are emerging, but also new challenges, and contamination is quickly becoming critical.
  Business applications and fundraising in AI have reached a scale at which a few
  percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate
  into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At
  the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs
  have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not
  divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes
  a critical issue: LLMs'' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance
  may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation
  jeopardizes the entire progress in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of
  methods on how to efficiently address contamination, or a clear consensus on prevention,
  mitigation and classification of contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent
  work on contamination with LLMs, and help the community track contamination levels
  of LLMs by releasing an open-source Python library named LLMSanitize implementing
  major contamination detection algorithms, which link is: this https URL.
