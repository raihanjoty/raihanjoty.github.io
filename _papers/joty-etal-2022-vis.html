abstract: 'This tutorial will provide an introduction to natural language processing
  (NLP) to interested researchers in the visualization (Vis) community. It will first
  motivate why NLP4Vis is an important area of research and provide an overview of
  research topics on combining NLP and Vis techniques. Then an overview of deep learning
  models for NLP will be covered. A particular focus will be provided on highlighting
  the recent progress on large language models such as ChatGPT and how such models
  can be leveraged to solve various NLP tasks for visualizations. In the final part,
  we will focus on various application tasks at the intersection of NLP and Vis. We
  will conclude with an interactive discussion of future challenges for NLP+Vis applications.
  The audience will include researchers interested in applying NLP for visualizations
  as well as others who focus more generally at the intersection of AI and visualization.
