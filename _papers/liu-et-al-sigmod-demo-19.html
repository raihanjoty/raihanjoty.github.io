abstract: 'A core component of a database systems course at the undergraduate level
  is the design and implementation of the query optimizer in a rdbms. The query optimization
  process produces a query execution plan (qep) which represents an execution strategy
  for a sql query. Unfortunately, in practice, it is often difficult for a student
  to comprehend the query execution strategy by perusing the qep, hindering her learning
  process. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called neuron that facilitates
  natural language interaction with qeps to enhance its understanding. neuron accepts
  a sql query (which may include joins, aggregation, nesting, among other things)
  as input, executes it, and generates a simplified natural language-based description
  (both in text and voice form) of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying
  rdbms. Furthermore, it facilitates understanding of various features related to
  the qep through a natural language-based question answering framework.We advocate
  that such tool, world’s first of its kind, can greatly enhance students’ learning
  of the query optimization topic.
