abstract: 'This work concerns automatic topic segmentation of email conversations.
  We present a corpus of email threads manually annotated with topics, and evaluate
  annotator reliability. To our knowledge, this is the first such email corpus. We
  show how the existing topic segmentation models (i.e., Lexical Chain Segmenter (LCSeg)
  and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) which are solely based on lexical information,
  can be applied to emails. By pointing out where these methods fail and what any
  desired model should consider, we propose two novel extensions of the models that
  not only use lexical information but also exploit finer level conversation structure
  in a principled way. Empirical evaluation shows that LCSeg is a better model than
  LDA for segmenting an email thread into topical clusters and incorporating conversation
  structure into these models improves the performance significantly
