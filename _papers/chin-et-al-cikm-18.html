abstract: 'Textual reviews, which are readily available on many e-commerce and review
  websites such as Amazon and Yelp, serve as an invaluable source of information for
  recommender systems. However, not all parts of the reviews are equally important,
  and the same choice of words may reflect a different meaning based on its context.
  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Aspect-based Neural Recommender (ANR)
  to perform aspect-based representation learning for both users and items via an
  attention-based component. Furthermore, we model the multi-faceted process behind
  how users rate items by estimating the aspect-level user and item importance by
  adapting the neural co-attention mechanism. Our proposed model concurrently address
  several shortcomings of existing recommender systems, and a thorough experimental
  study on 25 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp shows that ANR significantly
  outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCoNN, D-Attn
  and ALFM.
