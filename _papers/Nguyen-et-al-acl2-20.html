abstract: 'We propose Differentiable Window, a new neural module and general purpose
  component for dynamic window selection. While universally applicable, we demonstrate
  a compelling use case of utilizing Differentiable Window to improve standard attention
  modules by enabling  more focused attentions over the input regions. We propose
  two variants of Differentiable Window, and integrate them within the Transformer
  architecture in two novel ways. We evaluate our proposed approach on a myriad of
  NLP tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, subject-verb agreement
  and language modeling. Our experimental results demonstrate consistent and sizable
  improvements across all tasks.
