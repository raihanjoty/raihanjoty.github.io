abstract: 'Submodularity is a desirable property for a variety of objectives in content
  selection where the current neural encoder-decoder framework is deficient. We propose
  diminishing attentions, a class of novel attention mechanisms that exploit the properties
  of submodular functions. The resulting attention module offers an architecturally
  simple yet empirically effective method to improve the coverage of neural text generation.
  We run on three directed text generation tasks with different levels of recovering
  rate, across two modalities, three neural model architectures and two training strategy
  variations. The results and analyses demonstrate that our method generalizes well
  across these settings, produces texts of good quality, outperforms comparable baselines
  and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
