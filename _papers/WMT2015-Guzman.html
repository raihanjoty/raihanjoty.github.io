abstract: 'In this paper, we take a closer look at the MT evaluation process from
  a glass-box perspective using eye-tracking. We analyze two aspects of the evaluation
  task: the background of evaluators (monolingual or bilingual) and the sources of
  information available, and we evaluate them using time and consistency as criteria.
  Our findings show that monolinguals are slower but more consistent than bilinguals,
  especially when only target language information is available. When exposed to various
  sources of information, evaluators in general take more time and in the case of
  monolinguals, there is a drop in consistency. Our findings suggest that to have
  consistent and cost effective MT evaluations, it is better to use monolinguals with
  only target language information.
