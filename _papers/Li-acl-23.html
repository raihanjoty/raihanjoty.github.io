abstract: 'With the evolution of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), new entities emerge which
  are not seen before. Representation learning of KGs in such an inductive setting
  aims to capture and transfer the structural patterns from existing entities to new
  entities. However, the performance of existing methods in inductive KGs are limited
  by sparsity and implicit transfer. In this paper, we propose VMCL, a Contrastive
  Learning (CL) framework with graph guided Variational autoencoder on Meta-KGs in
  the inductive setting. We first propose representation generation to capture the
  encoded and generated representations of entities, where the generated variations
  can densify representations with complementary features. Then, we design two CL
  objectives that work across entities and meta-KGs to simulate the transfer mode.
  With extensive experiments we demonstrate that our proposed VMCL can significantly
  outperform previous state-of-the-art baselines.
