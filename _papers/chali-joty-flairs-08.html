abstract: 'When a user is served with a ranked list of relevant documents by the standard
  document search engines, his search task is usually not over. He has to go through
  the entire document contents to judge its relevance and to find the precise piece
  of information he was looking for. Query–relevant summarization tries to remove
  the onus on the end–user by providing more condensed and direct access to relevant
  information. Query–relevant summarization is the task to synthesize a fluent, well–organized
  summary of the document collection that answers the user questions. We extracted
  several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, statistical
  and cosine similarity ) for each of the sentences in the document collection in
  order to measure its relevancy to the user query. We experimented with two well–known
  unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K–means and EM algorithms
  and evaluated their performances. For all these methods of generating summaries,
  we have shown the effects of different kinds of features.
