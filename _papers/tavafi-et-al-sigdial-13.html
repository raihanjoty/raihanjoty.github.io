abstract: 'In this work, we study the effectiveness of state-of-the-art, sophisticated
  supervised learning algorithms for dialogue act modeling across a comprehensive
  set of different spoken and written conversations including: emails, forums, meetings,
  and phone conversations. To this aim, we compare the results of SVM-multiclass and
  two structured predictors namely SVMhmm and CRF algorithms. Extensive empirical
  results, across different conversational modalities, demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our SVM-hmm model for dialogue act recognition in conversations.
