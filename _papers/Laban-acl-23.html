abstract: 'Text simplification research has mostly focused on sentence-level simplification,
  even though many desirable edits - such as adding relevant background information
  or reordering content - may require document-level context. Prior work has also
  predominantly framed simplification as a single-step, input-to-output task, only
  implicitly modeling the fine-grained, span-level edits that elucidate the simplification
  process. To address both gaps, we introduce the SWiPE dataset, which reconstructs
  the document-level editing process from English Wikipedia (EW) articles to paired
  Simple Wikipedia (SEW) articles.  In contrast to prior work, SWiPE leverages the
  entire revision history when pairing pages in order to better identify simplification
  edits. We work with Wikipedia editors to annotate 5,000 EW-SEW document pairs, labeling
  more than 40,000 edits with proposed 19 categories. To scale our efforts, we propose
  several models to automatically label edits, achieving an F-1 score of up to 71.8,
  indicating that this is a tractable but challenging NLU task.  Finally, we categorize
  the edits produced by several simplification models and find that SWiPE-trained
  models generate more complex edits while reducing unwanted edits.
