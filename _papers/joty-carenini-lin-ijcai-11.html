abstract: 'We present unsupervised approaches to the problem of modeling dialog acts
  in asynchronous conversations; i.e., conversations where participants collaborate
  with each other at different times. In particular, we investigate a graph-theoretic
  deterministic framework and two probabilistic conversation models (i.e., HMM and
  HMM+Mix) for modeling dialog acts in emails and forums. We train and test our conversation
  models on (a) temporal order and (b) graph-structural order of the datasets. Empirical
  evaluation suggests (i) the graph-theoretic framework that relies on lexical and
  structural similarity metrics is not the right model for this task, (ii) conversation
  models perform better on the graphstructural order than the temporal order of the
  datasets and (iii) HMM+Mix is a better conversation model than the simple HMM model.
