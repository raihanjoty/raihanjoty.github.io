abstract: 'Most state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems, despite being
  different in architectural skeletons (e.g. recurrence, convolutional), share an
  indispensable feature: the Attention. However, most existing attention methods are
  token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, the key ingredient
  for the success of phrase-based statistical machine translation. In this paper,
  we propose novel phrase-based attention methods to model n-grams of tokens as attention
  entities. We incorporate our phrase-based attentions into the recently proposed
  Transformer network, and demonstrate that our approach yields improvements of 1.3
  BLEU for English-to-German and 0.5 BLEU for German-to-English translation tasks
  on WMT newstest2014 using WMT''16 training data.
