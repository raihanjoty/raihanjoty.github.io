abstract: 'The tasks in fine-grained opinion mining can be regarded as either a token-level
  sequence labeling problem or as a semantic compositional task. We propose a general
  class of discriminative models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and word
  embeddings that can be successfully applied to such tasks without any taskspecific
  feature engineering effort. Our experimental results on the task of opinion target
  identification show that RNNs, without using any hand-crafted features, outperform
  feature-rich CRF-based models. Our framework is flexible, allows us to incorporate
  other linguistic features, and achieves results that rival the top performing systems
  in SemEval-2014.
