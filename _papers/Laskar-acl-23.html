abstract: 'While large language models have the potential to benefit society greatly,
  it is important that we use them responsibly. The recently released ChatGPT language
  model has drawn a lot of attention, with discussions ongoing whether it achieves
  impressive performance due to its memorization power for being trained on a massive
  amount of data, or if it has complex reasoning capability to solve challenging tasks.
  This paper aims to systematically evaluate these issues. In particular, it focuses
  on investigating the performance of ChatGPT on academic benchmark datasets, assessing
  the quality of its generated text, exploring its open-domain knowledge and commonsense
  reasoning, as well as emerging capability. In addition, we study its potential limitations,
  such as biases, misinformation generation, and ethical concerns. Our extensive evaluation
  shows that even though ChatGPT is capable of performing a wide variety of tasks,
  and may obtain impressive performance in several benchmark datasets, it is still
  far from achieving the ability to reliably solve many language processing tasks
  in challenging scenarios.
