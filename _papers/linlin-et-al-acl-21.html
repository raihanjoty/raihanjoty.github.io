abstract: 'Named Entity Recognition (NER) for low-resource languages is a both practical
  and challenging research problem. This paper addresses zero-shot transfer for cross-lingual
  NER, especially when the amount of source-language training data is also limited.
  The paper first proposes a simple but effective labeled sequence translation method
  to translate source-language training data to target languages and avoids problems
  such as word order change and entity span determination. With the source-language
  data as well as the translated data, a generation-based multilingual data augmentation
  method is introduced to further increase diversity by generating synthetic labeled
  data in multiple languages. These augmented data enable the language model based
  NER models to generalize better with both the language-specific features from the
  target-language synthetic data and the language-independent features from multilingual
  synthetic data. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to demonstrate encouraging
  cross-lingual transfer performance of the new research on a wide variety of target
  languages. The code and data in this work will be made public for the research community.
