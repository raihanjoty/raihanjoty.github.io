abstract: 'One of the main challenges in the applica- tions (i.e.: text summarization,
  question an- swering, information retrieval, etc.) of Natural Language Processing
  is to deter- mine which of the several senses of a word is used in a given context.
  The problem is phrased as “Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)” in the NLP community.
  This paper presents the dictionary based disambigua- tion technique that adopts
  the assumption of one sense per discourse in the context of SemEval-2007 Task 7:
  “Coarse-grained English all-words”.
