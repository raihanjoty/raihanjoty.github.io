abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
  handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However,
  recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their
  reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability
  and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as
  planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless,
  the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent
  assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space.
  Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly
  and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper,
  we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference
  Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized
  process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass
  the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.
