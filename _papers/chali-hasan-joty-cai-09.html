abstract: 'In this paper, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based ensemble
  approach to combat the extractive multi-document summarization problem. Although
  SVM can have a good generalization ability, it may experience a performance degradation
  through wrong classifications. We use a committee of several SVMs, i.e. Cross-Validation
  Committees (CVC), to form an ensemble of classifiers where the strategy is to improve
  the performance by correcting errors of one classifier using the accurate output
  of others. The practicality and effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated
  using the experimental results.
