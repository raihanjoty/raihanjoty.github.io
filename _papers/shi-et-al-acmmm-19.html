abstract: 'With the rapid growth of video data and the increasing demands of various
  applications such as intelligent video search and assistance toward visually-impaired
  people, video captioning task has received a lot of attention recently in computer
  vision and natural language processing fields. The state-of-the-art video captioning
  methods focus more on encoding the temporal information, while lack of effective
  ways to remove irrelevant temporal information and also neglecting the spatial details.
  However, the current RNN encoding module in single time order can be influenced
  by the irrelevant temporal information, especially the irrelevant temporal information
  is at the beginning of the encoding. In addition, neglecting spatial information
  will lead to the relationship confusion of the words and detailed loss. Therefore,
  in this paper, we propose a novel recurrent video encoding method and a novel visual
  spatial feature for the video captioning task. The recurrent encoding module encodes
  the video twice with the predicted key frame to avoid the irrelevant temporal information
  often occurring at the beginning and the end of a video. The novel spatial features
  represent the spatial information in different regions of a video and enrich the
  details of a caption. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show superior performance
  of the proposed method.
