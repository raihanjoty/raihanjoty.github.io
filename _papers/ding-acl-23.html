abstract: 'Data annotation is the process of labeling data that could be used to train
  machine learning models. It is a crucial step in the development of NLP systems,
  as it allows the model to learn the relationship between the input data and the
  desired output. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a large-scale language
  model developed by OpenAI, has demonstrated impressive zero- and few-shot performance
  on a wide range of NLP tasks. It is therefore natural to wonder whether it can be
  used to effectively annotate data for NLP tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the
  performance of GPT-3 as a data annotator by comparing it with traditional data annotation
  methods and analyzing its output on a range of tasks. Through this analysis, we
  aim to provide insight into the potential of GPT-3 as a general-purpose data annotator
  in NLP.
