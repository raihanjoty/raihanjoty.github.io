abstract: 'Participants in asynchronous conversations (e.g., forums, emails) interact
  with each other at different times, performing certain communicative acts, called
  speech acts (e.g., question, request). In this article, we propose a hybrid approach
  to speech act recognition in asynchronous conversations. Our approach works in two
  main steps: a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) first encodes
  each sentence separately into a task-specific distributed representation, which
  is then used in a conditional random field (CRF) model to capture the conversational
  dependencies between sentences. The LSTM-RNN uses pretrained word embeddings learned
  from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences into speech
  act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational
  dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem
  of limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model
  to learn from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using domain adversarial
  training of neural networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our
  approach over existing ones: (i) LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations,
  (ii) conversational word embeddings benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf
  ones, (iii) adversarial training gives better domain-invariant representations,
  and (iv) the global CRF model improves over local models.
