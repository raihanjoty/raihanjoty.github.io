abstract: 'Joint models have recently shown to improve the state-of-the-art in machine
  translation (MT). We apply EM-based mixture modeling and data selection techniques
  using two joint models, namely the Operation Sequence Model or OSM — an ngram-based
  translation and reordering model, and the Neural Network Joint Model or NNJM — a
  continuous space translation model, to carry out domain adaptation for MT. The diversity
  of the two models, OSM with inherit reordering information and NNJM with continuous
  space modeling makes them interesting to be explored for this task. Our contribution
  in this paper is fusing the existing known techniques (linear interpolation, cross-entropy)
  with the state-of-the-art MT models (OSM, NNJM). On a standard task of translating
  German-to-English and Arabic-to-English IWSLT TED talks, we observed statistically
  significant improvements of up to +0.9 BLEU points.
