abstract: "Rumors spread in social media severely jeopardize the credibility of online\
  \ content. Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social\
  \ media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute\
  \ its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can\
  \ form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose\
  \ to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential\
  \ propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying\
  \ rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we firstly represent the diffusion\
  \ of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how\
  \ a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present\
  \ a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks\
  \ (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform\
  \ to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation\
  \ learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding\
  \ evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity\
  \ of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat\
  \ every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms\
  \ for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts\
  \ during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four\
  \ datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that 1) our RvNN-based\
  \ models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than\
  \ state-of-the-art approaches; 2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential\
  \ posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and 3) our\
  \ approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at very early stage.\
