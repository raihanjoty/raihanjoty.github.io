abstract: 'We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural
  networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation
  from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical,
  syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is
  embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer
  neural network that models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses
  and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. We experiment with the
  benchmark datasets from the \WMT\ Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best
  results published so far, with the basic network configuration. We also perform
  a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different
  components of the network. We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning
  of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional
  and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and
  generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an \MT\ evaluation
  metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with the state of the
  art.
