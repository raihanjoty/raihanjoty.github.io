abstract: 'Rumors spread in social media severely jeopardize the credibility of online
  content. Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social
  media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute
  its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can
  form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to
  learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential
  propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying
  rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we firstly represent the diffusion
  of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a
  claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present
  a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks
  (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform
  to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation
  learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding
  evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity
  of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat
  every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms
  for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts
  during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four
  datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that 1) our RvNN-based
  models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art
  approaches; 2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further
  improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and 3) our approach possesses
  superior capacity on detecting rumors at very early stage.
