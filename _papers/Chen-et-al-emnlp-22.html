abstract: 'Sparsity of formal knowledge and roughness of non-ontological construction
  methods make sparsity problem particularly prominent in Open Knowledge Graphs (OpenKGs).
  Due to sparse links, learning effective representation for few-shot entities becomes
  difficult. We hypothesize that by introducing negative  samples, a contrastive learning
  (CL) formulation could be beneficial in such scenarios. However, existing CL methods
  consider binary objects while modeling KG triplets and they are too generic, i.e.,
  they ignore zero-shot, few-shot and synonymity problems that appear in OpenKGs.
  To address this, we propose TernaryCL, a CL framework based on ternary propagation
  patterns among head, relation and tail. TernaryCL designs  \emphContrastive Entity
  and \emphContrastive Relation to mine ternary discriminative features by considering
  both negative entities and relations. It also introduces \emphContrastive Self to
  help zero- and few-shot entities learn discriminative features, \emphContrastive
  Synonym to consider synonymous entities, and \emphContrastive Fusion to aggregate
  graph features from multiple paths. With extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
  we demonstrate the superiority of TernaryCL over state-of-the-art models.
