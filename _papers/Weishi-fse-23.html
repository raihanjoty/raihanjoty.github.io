abstract: 'Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to reduce manual debugging efforts
  for developers and improve software reliability. While conventional search-based
  techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy assumption to mine
  fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep learning (DL) based
  approaches to automate the program repair process in a data-driven manner. However,
  their performance is often limited by a fixed set of parameters to model the highly
  complex search space of APR.  To ease such burden on the parametric models, in this
  work, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen)
  by explicitly leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous
  bug-fix pairs Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both
  lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a language-agnostic
  manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In addition, we adapt
  a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our founda tion model to facilitate both patch
  retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We adopt a stage-wise approach
  where the patch retriever first retrieves a relevant external bug-fix pair to augment
  the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch generator, which synthesizes a ranked list
  of repair patch candidates. Notably, RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can
  flexibly integrate different patch retrievers and generators to repair various types
  of bugs.  We thoroughly evaluate RAP-Gen on three benchmarks in two programming
  languages, including the TFix benchmark in JavaScript, and Code Refinement and Defects4J
  benchmarks in Java, where the bug localization information may or may not be provided.
  Experimental results show that RAP-Gen significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
  (SoTA) approaches on all benchmarks, e.g., boosting the accuracy of T5-large on
  TFix from 49.70% to 54.15% (repairing 478 more bugs) and repairing 15 more bugs
  on 818 Defects4J bugs. Further analysis reveals that our patch retriever can search
  for relevant fix patterns to guide the APR systems.
