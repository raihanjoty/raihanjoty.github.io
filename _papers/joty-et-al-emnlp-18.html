abstract: 'We address, for the first time, the joint resolution of two important Question
  Answering tasks on community forums: given a new question, (i) find related existing
  questions, and (ii) find relevant answers to the new question. We further use an
  auxiliary task to complement the previous two, i.e., (iii) find good answers with
  respect to the thread question in a question-comment thread. We use deep neural
  networks (DNNs) to learn meaningful task-specific embeddings, which we then incorporate
  into a conditional random field (CRF) model on the multitask problem, performing
  joint learning over arbitrary graph structures. The experimental results show that
  DNNs alone achieve competitive results when trained to produce the embeddings. Furthermore,
  the CRF model is able to effectively make use of the embeddings and the dependencies
  between the tasks to improve results significantly and consistently across a variety
  of evaluation metrics, thus showing the complementarity of DNNs and structured learning.
