abstract: 'Sufficient physical activity and restful sleep play a major role in the
  prevention and cure of many chronic conditions. Being able to proactively screen
  and monitor such chronic conditions would be a big step forward for overall health.
  The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable devices provides a significant
  new source, making it possible to track the user’s lifestyle real-time. In this
  paper, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning technique called
  activ- ity2vec that learns and “summarizes” the discrete-valued ac- tivity time-series.
  It learns the representations with three com- ponents: (i) the co-occurrence and
  magnitude of the activity levels in a time-segment, (ii) neighboring context of
  the time- segment, and (iii) promoting subject-invariance with adver- sarial training.
  We evaluate our method on four disorder pre- diction tasks using linear classifiers.
  Empirical evaluation and analysis demonstrate that our proposed method performs
  bet- ter than many strong baselines, and adversarial learning helps improve the
  generalizability of our representations by pro- moting subject invariant features.
  We also show that using the representations at the level of a day works the best
  since human activity is structured in terms of daily routines.
