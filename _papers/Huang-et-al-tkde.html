abstract: 'Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis,
  offering critical insights and aiding in informed decisionmaking. Automatic chart
  understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation
  models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized
  various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to
  chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of
  the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding
  within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks
  crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various
  tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs.
  Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based
  and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance
  chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance
  of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future
  directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as
  domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented
  settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and
  practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and
  data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in
  chart understanding leveraging large foundation models. The studies mentioned in
  this paper, along with emerging new research, will be continually updated at: https://github.com/khuangaf/Awesome-Chart-Understanding
