abstract: 'Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning bilingual
  dictionary without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared
  space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods
  in more challenging language pairs. In this work, we revisit adversarial autoencoder
  for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield
  more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms
  to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders
  as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. Extensive experimentations
  with European and non-European languages show that our method achieves better performance
  than recently proposed adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive
  with the supervised system.
