abstract: 'The success of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) largely depends on the
  availability of large bitext training corpora. Due to the lack of such large corpora
  in low-resource language pairs,  NMT systems often exhibit poor performance. Extra
  relevant monolingual data often helps, but acquiring it could be quite expensive,
  especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, domain mismatch between bitext
  (train/test) and monolingual data might degrade the performance. To alleviate such
  issues, we propose AugVic, a novel data augmentation framework for low-resource
  NMT which exploits the vicinal samples of the given bitext without using any extra
  monolingual data explicitly. It can diversify the in-domain bitext data with finer
  level control. Through extensive experiments on four low-resource language pairs
  comprising data from different domains, we have shown that our method is comparable
  to the traditional back-translation that uses extra in-domain monolingual data.
  When we combine the synthetic parallel data generated from AugVic with the ones
  from the extra monolingual data, we achieve further improvements. We show that AugVic
  helps to attenuate the discrepancies between relevant and distant-domain monolingual
  data in traditional back-translation. To understand the contributions of different
  components of AugVic, we perform an in-depth framework analysis.
