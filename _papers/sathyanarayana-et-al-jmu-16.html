abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient
  sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude
  of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity
  and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during
  the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current
  popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy
  devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help
  to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights
  into sleep science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility
  of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical
  activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting
  good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality. METHODS: Actigraphy
  sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns.
  The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from
  a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake
  time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor
  or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for
  the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression
  with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional
  neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term
  memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM). RESULTS: Deep
  learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep
  efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep
  learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. “CNN had
  the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver
  operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared
  with traditional logistic regression (0.6463). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning methods
  can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These
  predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth
  solutions for sleep.
