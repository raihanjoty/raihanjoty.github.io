abstract: 'Most existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated to
  improving the accuracy of predicted answers, while disregarding the explanations.
  We argue that the explanation for an answer is of the same or even more importance
  compared with the answer itself, since it makes the question and answering process
  more understandable and traceable. To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA
  with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation
  with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the
  VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically
  derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions.
  We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized
  by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations
  can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also
  improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset.
