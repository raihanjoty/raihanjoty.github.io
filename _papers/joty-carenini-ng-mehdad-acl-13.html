abstract: 'We propose a novel approach for developing a two-stage document-level discourse
  parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm
  to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intrasentential
  parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. We present two approaches to
  combine these two stages of discourse parsing effectively. A set of empirical evaluations
  over two different datasets demonstrates that our discourse parser significantly
  outperforms the stateof-the-art, often by a wide margin.
