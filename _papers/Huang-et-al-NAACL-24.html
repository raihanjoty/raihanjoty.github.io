abstract: 'Previous research in multi-document news summarization has typically concentrated
  on collating information that all sources agree upon. However, to our knowledge,
  the summarization of diverse information dispersed across multiple articles about
  an event has not been previously investigated. The latter imposes a different set
  of challenges for a summarization model. In this paper, we propose a new task of
  summarizing diverse information encountered in multiple news articles encompassing
  the same event. To facilitate this task, we outlined a data collection schema for
  identifying diverse information and curated a dataset named DiverseSumm. The dataset
  includes 245 news stories, with each story comprising 10 news articles and paired
  with a human-validated reference. Moreover, we conducted a comprehensive analysis
  to pinpoint the position and verbosity biases when utilizing Large Language Model
  (LLM)-based metrics for evaluating the coverage and faithfulness of the summaries,
  as well as their correlation with human assessments. We applied our findings to
  study how LLMs summarize multiple news articles by analyzing which type of diverse
  information LLMs are capable of identifying. Our analyses suggest that despite the
  extraordinary capabilities of LLMs in single-document summarization, the proposed
  task remains a complex challenge for them mainly due to their limited coverage,
  with GPT-4 only able to cover less than 40% of the diverse information on average.
