abstract: 'Conversational machine reading aims to teach machines to interact with
  users and answer their questions. It is challenging because machines have to understand
  the knowledge base text, evaluate and keep track of the user scenario, ask clarification
  questions, and then make a final decision. Existing approaches have implicit rule
  text reasoning processes for decision making and weak abilities for question-related
  rule extraction. In this paper, we present a new framework of conversational machine
  reading with a novel Explicit Memory Tracker (EMT) that explicitly tracks whether
  conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision.
  Moreover, our framework generates clarifying questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine
  reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level selection scores to weight token-level
  distributions. On the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set), EMT achieves new
  state-of-the-art results of 74.8% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 46.0 BLEU4.
  We also show that EMT is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented
  reasoning process as the conversation flows. Code and models will be released to
  facilitate research along this line.
