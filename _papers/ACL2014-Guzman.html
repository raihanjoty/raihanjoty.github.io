abstract: 'We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine
  translation evaluation. We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures,
  which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with
  the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures can help improve
  a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segmentand
  at the system-level. Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse
  information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus
  should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.
