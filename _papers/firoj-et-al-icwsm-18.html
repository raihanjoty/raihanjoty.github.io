abstract: 'During time-critical situations such as natural disasters, rapid classification
  of data posted on social networks by affected people is useful for humanitarian
  organizations to gain situational awareness and to plan response efforts. However,
  the scarcity of labeled data in the early hours of a crisis hinders machine learning
  tasks thus delays crisis response. In this work, we propose to use an inductive
  semi-supervised technique to utilize unlabeled data, which is often abundant at
  the onset of a crisis event, along with fewer labeled data. Specifically, we adopt
  a graph-based deep learning framework to learn an inductive semi-supervised model.
  We use two realworld crisis datasets from Twitter to evaluate the proposed approach.
  Our results show significant improvements using unlabeled data as compared to only
  using labeled data.
