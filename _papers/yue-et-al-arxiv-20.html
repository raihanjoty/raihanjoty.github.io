abstract: 'Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, where a dialog agent
  needs to answer a series of questions through reasoning on the image content and
  dialog history. Prior work has mostly focused on various attention mechanisms to
  model such intricate interactions. By contrast, in this work, we propose VD-BERT,
  a simple yet effective framework of unified vision-dialog Transformer that leverages
  the pretrained BERT language models for Visual Dialog tasks. The model is unified
  in that (1) it captures all the interactions between the image and the multi-turn
  dialog using a single-stream Transformer encoder, and (2) it supports both answer
  ranking and answer generation seamlessly through the same architecture. More crucially,
  we adapt BERT for the effective fusion of vision and dialog contents via visually
  grounded training. Without the need of pretraining on external vision-language data,
  our model yields new state of the art, achieving the top position in both single-model
  and ensemble settings (74.54 and 75.35 NDCG scores) on the visual dialog leaderboard.
