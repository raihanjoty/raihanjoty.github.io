abstract: 'Large scale multilingual pre-trained language models have shown promising
  results in zero- and few-shot cross-lingual tasks. However, recent studies have
  shown their lack of generalizability when the languages are structurally dissimilar.
  In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method based on co-training that aims
  to learn more generalized semantic equivalences as complementary to multilingual
  language modeling using the unlabeled data in the target language.  We also propose
  an adaption method based on contrastive learning to better capture the semantic
  relationship in the parallel data, when a few translation pairs are available. To
  show our method''s effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual
  inference and review classification tasks across various languages. We report significant
  gains compared to directly fine-tuning multilingual pre-trained models and other
  semi-supervised alternatives.\footnoteCode and models are available at \scriptsize{\urlstyle{tt\url<redacted>}}.
